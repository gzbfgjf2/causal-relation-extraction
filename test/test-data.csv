https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	15	Anthropogenic methane: Methane emissions derived from human activities.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	16	Anthropogenic emission sources include coal mining, agricultural practices, wastewater treatment, certain industrial processes and oil and gas systems, among others.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	17	In the context of climate change transformation pathways, the term ‘baseline scenarios’ refers to scenarios that are based on the assumption that no mitigation policies or measures will be implemented beyond those that are already in force and/or are legislated or planned to be adopted.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	18	Baseline scenarios are not intended to be predictions of the future, but rather counterfactual constructions that can serve to highlight the level of emissions that would occur without further policy effort.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	19	Typically, baseline scenarios are compared to mitigation scenarios that are constructed to meet different goals for greenhouse gas emissions, atmospheric concentrations or temperature change.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	20	The term ‘baseline scenario’ is used interchangeably with ‘reference scenario’ and ‘no policy scenario’ In much of the literature, the term is also synonymous with the term ‘business as usual (BAU) scenario’, although the term ‘BAU’ has fallen out of favour because the idea of ‘business as usual’ in centurylong socioeconomic projections is hard to fathom.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	21	Carbon border adjustment mechanisms: Mechanisms that act to equalize the price of carbon between domestic products and imports to eliminate financial incentives in order to relocate production outside of regions with strong climate controls.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	22	Carbon dioxide emission budget (or carbon budget): For a given temperature rise limit, for example a 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	23	Stated differently, a carbon budget is the area under a carbon dioxide (CO2) emission trajectory that satisfies assumptions about limits on cumulative emissions estimated to avoid a certain level of global mean surface temperature rise.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	24	Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e): A way to place emissions of various radiative forcing agents on a common footing by accounting for their effect on climate.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	25	It describes, for a given mixture and amount of greenhouse gases, the amount of CO2 that would have the same global warming ability, when measured over a specified time period.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	26	For the purpose of this report, greenhouse gas emissions (unless otherwise specified) are the sum of the basket of greenhouse gases listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol, expressed as CO2e assuming a 100-year global warming potential.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	27	Carbon markets: A term for a carbon trading system through which countries may buy or sell units of greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to meet their national limits on emissions, either under the Kyoto Protocol or other agreements, such as that among member states of the European Union.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	28	The term comes from the fact that CO2 is the predominant greenhouse gas, and other gases are measured in units called carbon dioxide equivalent.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	29	Carbon neutrality: This is achieved when an actor’s net contribution to global CO2 emissions is zero.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	30	Any CO2 emissions attributable to an actor’s activities are fully compensated by CO2 reductions or removals exclusively claimed by the actor, irrespective of the time period or the relative magnitude of emissions and removals involved.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	31	This may refer to the rate of a carbon tax or the price of emission permits.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	32	In many models that are used to assess the economic costs of mitigation, carbon prices are used as a proxy to represent the level of effort in mitigation policies.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	33	Conditional nationally determined contribution (NDC): An NDC proposed by some countries that are contingent on a range of possible conditions, such as the ability of national legislatures to enact the necessary laws, ambitious action from other countries, realization of finance and technical support, or other factors.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	34	Conference of the Parties (COP): The supreme body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	35	Double counting: Double counting involves two countries taking credit for the same emissions reductions, thereby giving the impression that the world has reduced emissions more than it actually has.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	36	For example, emissions reduction credits from one country might be sold to another country, but the reductions may still be counted towards the achievement of the NDC of the country where the credits originated.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	37	Emission pathway: The trajectory of annual greenhouse gas emissions over time.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	38	Emissions trading: One of the three Kyoto mechanisms, by which an Annex I party may transfer Kyoto Protocol units to, or acquire units from, another Annex I party.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	39	An Annex I party must meet specific eligibility requirements to participate in emissions trading.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	40	The EU ETS covers the following sectors and gases: electricity and heat generation, energy-intensive industry sectors (including oil refineries, steel works and production of iron, aluminium, metals, cement, lime, glass, ceramics, pulp, paper, cardboard, acids and bulk organic chemicals, commercial aviation within the European Economic Area), nitrous oxide from production of nitric, adipic and glyoxylic acids and glyoxal, and perfluorocarbons from production of aluminium.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	41	Global warming potential: An index representing the combined effect of the differing times greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere and their relative effectiveness in absorbing outgoing infrared radiation.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	42	Greenhouse gases: The atmospheric gases responsible for causing global warming and climatic change.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	43	The major greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	44	Less prevalent, but very powerful, GHGs are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	45	Greenhouse gas removal: Withdrawal of a greenhouse gas and/or a precursor from the atmosphere by a sink.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	46	Integrated assessment models: Models that seek to combine knowledge from multiple disciplines in the form of equations and/or algorithms in order to explore complex environmental problems.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	47	As such, they describe the full chain of climate change, from production of greenhouse gases to atmospheric responses.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	48	This necessarily includes relevant links and feedbacks between socioeconomic and biophysical processes.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	49	Intended nationally determined contribution (INDC): INDCs are submissions from countries describing the national actions that they intend to take to reach the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal of limiting warming to well below 2°C.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	50	Once a country has ratified the Paris Agreement, its INDC is automatically converted to its NDC, unless it chooses to further update it.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	51	Katowice Climate Package: The Katowice Climate Package, also known as ‘the Katowice outcome ’, is a complex package containing operational guidance on information provision, communication and rules for the functioning of the climate transparency framework, the global stocktaking of overall progress and the evaluation of progress, and the provision of prior information on financial assistance.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	52	The package sets out the essential procedures and mechanisms that operationalized the Paris Agreement.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	53	The guidelines of the package aim to build greater trust and strengthen international cooperation.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	54	Kyoto Protocol: An international agreement, standing on its own, and requiring separate ratification by governments, but linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	55	The Kyoto Protocol, among other things, sets binding targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by industrialized countries.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	56	Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF): A greenhouse gas inventory sector that covers emissions and removals of greenhouse gases resulting from direct humaninduced land use, land-use change and forestry activities.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	57	Leakage: A phenomenon whereby the reduction in emissions (relative to a baseline) in a jurisdiction/sector associated with the implementation of mitigation policy is offset to some degree by an increase outside the jurisdiction/sector through induced changes in consumption, production, prices, land use and/or trade across the jurisdictions/sectors.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	58	Leakage can occur at a number of levels: project, state, province, nation or world region.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	59	It also assumes that global actions start at the base year of model simulations (usually close to the current year) and are implemented following a cost-optimal (cost-efficient) sharing of the mitigation burden between current and future generations depending on the social discount rate.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	60	Used in this assessment to convey the probabilities of meeting temperature limits.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	61	Mitigation: In the context of climate change, mitigation relates to a human intervention to reduce the sources, or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	62	Examples include using fossil fuels more efficiently for industrial processes or electricity generation, switching to solar energy or wind power, improving the insulation of buildings and expanding forests and other ‘sinks’ to remove greater amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	63	Nationally determined contribution (NDC): Submissions by countries that have ratified the Paris Agreement which presents their national efforts to reach the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal of limiting warming to well below 2°C.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	64	New or updated NDCs were expected to be submitted in 2020 and should be submitted every five years thereafter.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	65	Offset (in climate policy): A unit of CO2e emissions that is reduced, avoided or sequestered to compensate for emissions occurring elsewhere.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	66	Recovery-type measure: Fiscal, monetary or regulatory intervention by a government to reinvigorate economic activity in response to a crisis.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	67	Rescue-type measure: Immediate fiscal, monetary or regulatory intervention by a government to protect citizens’ lives and socioeconomic well-being and/or to provide emergency support to businesses and the economy in response to a crisis.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	68	Scenario: A description of how the future may unfold based on ‘if-then’ propositions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	69	Scenarios typically include an initial socioeconomic situation and a description of the key driving forces and future changes in emissions, temperature or other climate change-related variables.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	70	Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP): Scenarios of projected socioeconomic global changes up to 2100.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	71	They are used to derive greenhouse gas emissions scenarios associated with different climate policies scenarios.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	72	Source: Any process, activity or mechanism that releases a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas or aerosol into the atmosphere.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	73	As we saw this year, devastating impacts are spreading across the globe and growing ever stronger.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	74	The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change told us a few months ago that we have a 50 per cent chance of exceeding a 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	75	Climate action so far has been characterized by weak promises, not yet delivered.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	76	As the Emissions Gap Report 2021 shows, the updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement fall into the same trap.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	77	Reductions of 30 per cent are needed to stay on the least-cost pathway for 2°C and 55 per cent for 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	78	If nations only implement unconditional NDCs as they stand, we are likely to hit global warming of about 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	79	At the same time, this year’s Emissions Gap Report shows that the opportunity to use pandemic recovery spending to reduce emissions has been largely missed.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	80	For the 2°C Paris Agreement target, the additional need is lower: a drop in annual emissions of 13 GtCO2e by 2030.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	81	To be clear: we have eight years to make the plans, put in place the policies, implement them and ultimately deliver the cuts.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	82	Nations must put in place the policies to meet their new commitments and start implementing them immediately.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	83	Then they must zero in on net zero, ensuring these longterm commitments are linked to the NDCs, and that action is brought forward.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	84	It is time to get the policies in place to back the raised ambitions and, again, start implementing them.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	85	As this year’s Emissions Gap Report shows, there is huge potential for large cuts in methane emissions from the oil and gas, waste and agriculture sectors.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	86	Carbon markets could help to accelerate action by decreasing mitigation costs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	87	And as previous UNEP Emissions Gap Reports show, there is potential in nature-based solutions, renewables, energy efficiency and so much more.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	88	In 11 years, from 2010 to 2021, we have put in place policies that will lower annual emissions by 11 GtCO2e in 2030 compared to what would have happened without these policies.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	89	Inger Andersen Executive Director United Nations Environment Programme XVI Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Executive summary Introduction This twelfth edition of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report comes during a year of constant reminders that climate change is not in the distant future.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	90	Extreme weather events around the world – including flooding, droughts, wildfires, hurricanes and heatwaves – have continuously hit the news headlines.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	91	Thousands of people have been killed or displaced and economic losses are measured in the trillions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	92	Bearing witness to the increasingly clear signs of climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published the first report in its Sixth Assessment cycle addressing the “Physical Science Basis” in August 2021.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	93	Dubbed a “code red for humanity” by the United Nations Secretary-General, the IPCC report documents in far greater detail and with higher certainty than previous assessments how climate change and extreme events can be attributed to the build-up of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	94	Building on the new evidence from the IPCC, the twentysixth United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) is charged with the growing urgency of accelerating global ambition and action on both mitigation and adaptation.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	95	This year, the spotlight is on the new and updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that countries were requested to submit in advance of COP26.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	96	As the September 2021 version of the NDC Synthesis Report published by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) illustrates, the new and updated NDCs are insufficient to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	97	It expands the assessment to consider announced mitigation pledges for 2030 in addition to the new and updated NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	98	The report shows that new or updated NDCs and announced pledges for 2030 have only limited impact on global emissions and the emissions gap in 2030, reducing projected 2030 emissions by only 7.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	99	If continued throughout this century, they would result in warming of 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	100	The achievement of the net-zero pledges that an increasing number of countries are committing to would improve the situation, limiting warming to about 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	101	However, the 2030 commitments do not yet set G20 members (accounting for close to 80 per cent of GHG emissions) on a clear path towards net zero.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	102	Moreover, G20 members as a group do not have policies in place to achieve even the NDCs, much less net zero.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	103	Turning to some of the opportunities for bridging the emissions gap and getting on track to net zero, the report assesses the extent to which COVID-19 fiscal recovery measures are used to accelerate a green transition.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	104	It examines the scope for reducing emissions from methane, the second-mostimportant GHG in terms of current anthropogenic climate forcing, to bridge the gap and get on track to net zero.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	105	Finally, the report looks into a key negotiation issue for COP26: reaching agreement on how to move forward with article 6 of the Paris Agreement dealing with cooperative approaches and market mechanisms.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	106	At the same time, the use of markets and offsets in meeting net-zero emission goals is often unclear.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	107	As in previous years, the 2021 Emissions Gap Report has been guided by an experienced steering committee and prepared by an international team of leading scientists, assessing all available information, including that published in the context of the IPCC reports, as well as in other recent scientific literature.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	108	The assessment methodology and preliminary findings were made available to the governments of the countries specifically mentioned in the report to give them an opportunity to comment on the findings.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	109	Data are not yet available for all GHG emissions in 2020, but the drop in total global GHG emissions is anticipated to be smaller than the drop in fossil CO2 emissions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	110	Global greenhouse gas emissions from all sources, 1970–2020 CO2 emissions could grow by 4.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	111	It is unlikely that the reductions in emissions in 2020 will be detectible in the atmospheric growth rate, as the natural variability of around one part per million is far greater than the effect of a 5.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	112	Solving the climate problem requires rapid and sustained reductions in emissions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	113	New mitigation pledges for 2030 show some progress, but their aggregate effect on global emissions is insufficient.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	114	This year's assessment considers the new or updated NDCs communicated to the UNFCCC as well as announcements of new mitigation pledges for 2030 by China, Japan and the Republic of Korea not submitted as NDCs by 30 September.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	115	Around 18 per cent of the NDCs (from countries accounting for 13 per cent of global emissions) will not reduce 2030 emissions relative to the previous NDC.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	116	The remaining 33 per cent of NDCs (from countries accounting for 7 per cent of global emissions) contain insufficient detail to assess their impact on emissions relative to the previous NDC (figure ES.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	117	Typically, this is due to a lack of information in the previous NDC, rather than the current one; the current NDCs are more transparent.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	118	Effect of new or updated nationally determined contributions on 2030 greenhouse gas emissions relative to previous nationally determined contributions ▶ Of the countries that have submitted new or updated NDCs, more (89 per cent) have GHG targets than before (75 per cent).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	119	However, these targets are only marginally more comprehensive in terms of sector and gas coverage.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	120	The share of new or updated NDCs that are completely unconditional has increased from 24 per cent to 26 per cent, while the share of NDCs that are completely conditional has dropped from 31 per cent to 18 per cent.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	121	If the announced pledges of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea are also included, this aggregate reduction increases to just over 4 GtCO2e.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	122	Six G20 members have formally submitted updated NDCs with enhanced GHG mitigation pledges: Argentina, Canada, the EU27 (counting the EU27 and its three individual G20 member states France, Germany and Italy as one), South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States of America – all of which entail reduced emissions in 2030 of about 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	123	Two G20 members (Brazil and Mexico) have submitted targets that lead to an increase in emissions of 0.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	124	In addition, China, Japan and the Republic of Korea have announced enhanced pledges that result in annual reductions of about 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	125	Two G20 members (Australia and Indonesia) have submitted NDC targets, which are assessed not to lead to additional reduction relative to the previous NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	126	One G20 member (the Russian Federation) has submitted an NDC that improves upon its previous NDC, but still does not go beyond its current policies and another three G20 members (India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey) have not yet submitted a new or updated NDC.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	127	New or updated NDC with lower 2030 emissions than prior NDC New or updated NDC not comparable to prior NDC New or updated NDC with equal or higher 2030 emissions than prior NDC No new or updated NDC submitted XIX Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On ▶ In comparison, the aggregate impact of the new or updated NDC submissions for the non-G20 members is an annual reduction of 0.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	128	As a group, G20 members are not on track to achieve either their original or new 2030 pledges.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	129	Ten G20 members are on track to achieve their previous NDCs, while seven are off track.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	130	If current policy projections are used for those countries where policy projections are lower than what NDCs would deliver, the G20 members as a Figure ES.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	131	Impact of 2030 pledges (nationally determined contributions and other announced pledges) on 2030 global emissions compared with previous nationally determined contribution submissions group are projected to fall short of achieving their unconditional NDCs by 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	132	Among them, three members (India, the Russian Federation and Turkey) are projected to reduce their emissions to levels at least 15 per cent lower than their previous unconditional NDC emissions target levels under current policies, indicating that these countries have significant room for raising their NDC ambition.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	133	As at 30 September 2021, India and Turkey have not yet submitted a new or updated NDC, while the Russian Federation has submitted a new NDC that reduces emissions, but still results in higher emissions than implied by current policies.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	134	While there are many positive developments, there are also negative examples, such as fossil fuel extraction projects and coalfired power plant construction plans moving forward as well as rollback of environmental regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	135	Based on the central estimates of independent studies, a large number of G20 members (Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Russian Federation and Saudi Arabia) are expected to emit more in 2030 under implemented policies than they did in 2010.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	136	This is to be expected and it would indicate a lack of enhanced ambition if the new 2030 pledges were projected to be achieved with currently implemented policies.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	137	It is worth noting that Canada and the United States of America have submitted strengthened NDC targets, while independent studies suggest that they are not on track to meet their previous NDC targets with currently implemented policies.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	138	These two countries therefore need to make significant additional efforts to meet their new NDC targets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	139	Net-zero emissions targets are being defined in a variety of ways – the most important aspect from a global geophysical perspective being whether they cover all GHGs or CO2 only.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	140	Global net-zero CO2 emissions stabilize global warming, whereas netzero GHG emissions result in a peak then a decline in global warming.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	141	These pledges cover more than half of current global domestic GHG emissions, over half of gross domestic product (GDP) and one third of the global population.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	142	Thirteen targets covering 12 per cent of global emissions are enshrined in law.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	143	Eight targets are aimed at earlier years (2030–2045) and four at later years.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	144	In terms of emissions, however, the targets are split almost entirely and equally between 2050 (due to the European Union and United States of America pledges) and 2060 (due to China’s pledge).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	145	The majority are furthermore unclear or undecided on the inclusion of emissions from international aviation and shipping and the use of international offsets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	146	Few of the G20 members' NDC targets put emissions on a clear path towards net-zero pledges.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	147	There is an urgent need to back these pledges up with near-term targets and actions that give confidence that net-zero emissions can ultimately be achieved and the remaining carbon budget kept.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	148	All are for the year 2050, with the exception of China’s 2060 target and Germany’s target for 2045.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	149	The remaining eight G20 members have so far not set net-zero targets, but three of them have communicated long-term low GHG emission development strategies to the UNFCCC (Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	150	Most targets are unclear or undecided on the inclusion of offsets and of international aviation and shipping emissions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	151	Lack of clarity is also notable on coverage of sectors and gases, but pledges that are clear show  XXI Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On a tendency for comprehensive coverage.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	152	However, most show a lack of transparency regarding the approach taken to fairness, the plans for achievement (including on use of removals), and progress reporting and review.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	153	Only Canada, the European Union, France, Germany and the Republic of Korea have published their plans at the time of completing this report, and only these countries plus the United Kingdom have accountable processes for reviewing their targets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	154	Whether a linear, an accelerated, or a delayed path is followed will affect the climate outcome (figure ES.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	155	Therefore, limiting global warming to a specified level requires that the total amount of CO2 emissions ever emitted be kept within a finite carbon budget.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	156	New IPCC estimates put the remaining carbon budget to limit warming to 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	157	Current annual global CO2 emissions are above 40 GtCO2/year, meaning that urgent and deep emissions reductions over the next decade are required to stay within the remaining budgets.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	159	Additional cumulative emissions leading to higher warming, higher mitigation challenges, and greater difficulty in achieving the net-zero target on a linear path, or on an accelerated path.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	160	Linear: the NDC sets emissions approximately on a linear path towards achieving the net-zero target.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	161	Delayed: the NDC reduces emissions more slowly than implied by a linear path towards the net-zero target.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	162	Cumulative emissions and resulting global warming are higher compared to a linear path.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	163	Member states of the European Union have no separate assessment of their path to net zero, because their NDC is not assessed separately as part of this report.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	164	Of the nine G20 members for which an emissions path can be estimated based on their net-zero target and their NDC, none have NDC targets that put them on an accelerated path towards their net-zero emissions targets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	165	Five of these nine members, accounting for about one fifth of global domestic GHG emissions, have NDC targets that put the country’s domestic emissions onto a linear path towards achieving their net-zero targets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	166	In the other four cases, the NDCs lead to emissions in 2030 that are about 25 per cent to 95 per cent higher than a linear path towards their net-zero targets would imply.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	167	Recognizing that countries face very different circumstances, these countries urgently need strengthened and more ambitious near-term climate plans for their netzero targets to remain achievable.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	168	The emissions gap remains large: compared to previous unconditional NDCs, the new pledges for 2030 reduce projected 2030 emissions by only 7.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	169	The three least-cost scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement have been updated and their temperature outcomes reassessed based on the Contribution of Working Group I to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	170	As a result, global emissions in 2030 consistent with keeping global warming below 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	171	This implies that while the aggregate effect on global emissions in 2030 of new or updated NDCs and announced pledges is estimated at 4 GtCO2e (see point two of this summary), the gap with respect to 2°C is only reduced by 2 GtCO2e compared with last year.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	172	Around half of the decrease between the 2020 and 2021 Reports reflects climate policy progress in the countries, while the other half is because of the general slowdown of economies due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	173	This implementation gap in 2030 is 3 GtCO2e for unconditional NDCs and 5 GtCO2e for conditional NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	174	By 2030, annual emissions need to be 13 GtCO2e (range: 10–16 GtCO2e) lower than current unconditional NDCs imply for the 2°C goal, and 28 GtCO2e (range: 25–30 GtCO2e) lower for the 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	175	Both estimates are for a 66 per cent chance of staying below the stated temperature limit.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	176	If conditional NDCs are also considered, these gaps are reduced by around 2 GtCO2e and 3 GtCO2e respectively (figure ES.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	177	If the net-zero emissions pledges are additionally fully implemented, this estimate is lowered to around 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	178	This approach assumes a continuation of climate action beyond 2030, without further strengthening.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	180	Furthermore, it should be noted that this year’s estimates are based on improved methods and the latest climate assessment of Working Group I in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	181	These methodological updates alone lower temperature projections for unconditional NDCs by about 0.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	186	If conditional pledges are also fully implemented, these estimates are lowered to 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	187	By contrast, a continuation of current policies, which are insufficient to meet the 2030 pledges, is estimated to limit warming to 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	188	Even under this scenario, there is still more than 15 per cent chance that global warming will exceed 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	189	Finally, these estimated improvements from net-zero targets should be caveated by the fact that only a few current NDCs set countries’ emissions on a linear path towards reaching longer-term netzero targets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	190	The opportunity to use COVID-19 fiscal rescue and recovery spending to stimulate the economy while fostering a low-carbon transformation has been missed in most countries so far.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	191	Low-carbon rescue spending has incentivized decarbonization through green conditionalities attached to short-term business support.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	192	Low-carbon recovery investment has set out to accelerate the low-carbon transition directly by supporting green projects and indirectly by incorporating green incentives into traditional investment.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	193	Green reinforcement initiatives deliver long-term support to the projects and sectors targeted by green recovery investment.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	195	Of this, only around 17–19 per cent (US$390–440 billion) is likely to reduce GHG emissions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	196	Over 500 green rescue and recovery measures have been introduced globally.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	197	Policies have covered most emerging and established green industries (figure ES.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	198	The range of spending has been notably wider in advanced economies, with emerging market and developing economies focusing their green recovery funds on clean energy generation and natural capital investments.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	199	Almost 90 per cent of recovery spending is accounted for by seven countries: the Republic of Korea, Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Japan.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	200	The Global Recovery Observatory finds that, up to May 2021, France, Germany, Canada, Finland, Norway and Denmark can be classified as ‘leaders’ on green recovery, with green spending as a share of recovery spending ranging from 39 per cent to 75 per cent.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	201	The United Kingdom, Spain and Sweden also rank highly, according to Vivid Economics’ Greenness of Stimulus Index.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	202	Less diversified economies, rising debt as a percentage of GDP, and corresponding limited fiscal space have constrained the ability of emerging economies and low-income countries to mobilize resources.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	203	Additionally, without significantly increased climate finance, emerging markets and developing economies are likely to become the world’s top GHG emitters, all while disproportionately suffering the burden of climate change, which has historically been caused primarily by high-income nations.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	204	Reduction of methane emissions from the fossil fuel, waste and agriculture sectors can contribute significantly to closing the emissions gap and reduce warming in the short term.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	205	Abatement potential via technical measures is also large in the waste sector and to a lesser extent in agriculture, where it will be difficult to greatly mitigate emissions without changing diets at the global or regional levels.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	206	Additional measures, such as switching from natural gas to renewables, dietary changes and food waste reduction could add 15 per cent to the 2030 mitigation potential.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	207	There are, however, excellent opportunities to include additional methane reduction measures in NDCs, as several countries are already demonstrating, for example through actions such as upstream leak detection and repair in oil and gas systems, elimination of gas flaring, energy recovery from landfill gas, and reducing food waste and loss.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	208	Recent developments in measurement capabilities enable total emissions rates to be monitored, including at the facility scale for larger emission sources.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	209	Although these measurements will provide a much better basis for decisive actions, they need to be used systematically and to become a key element in preparing national policies.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	210	Carbon markets can deliver real emissions abatement and drive ambition, but only when rules are clearly defined, designed to ensure that transactions reflect actual reductions in emissions, and supported by arrangements to track progress and provide transparency.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	211	Markets can provide an opportunity for countries, companies and other actors to achieve their emission reduction goals at lower costs and thereby create room to enhance their ambition in both the near- and long term.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	212	Particularly, participants with hard-toabate emissions would be enabled to meet their mitigation goals at lower costs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	213	The agreed rules need to ensure environmental integrity and encourage enhanced ambition.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	214	In addition to potentially lowering the cost of additional ambition everywhere, markets could lead to a shift in capital investment towards selling regions, and in this way affect metrics such as local air quality, employment and sustainability, and shift costs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	215	Nevertheless, there is a risk that this could lead to reduced incentives for technological innovation in buying regions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	216	If the savings from more cost- XXIX Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On effective global implementation of NDCs were redeployed towards increased ambition, the emissions reductions planned in current NDCs could be roughly doubled over the next decade at no added cost to parties, compared to parties acting alone to implement their commitments.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	217	For this potential to be realized, these theoretical findings need to be translated into real-world policy changes.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	218	The challenge for COP26 negotiations is to decide on the necessary guidance for article 6 that can launch a global market that is able to gradually expand and improve as pledges evolve and experiences are gained.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	219	With narrowing cost differences over time, the volume of trading would likely diminish, while the transactional value would increase.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	220	The market would increasingly focus on CO2 removal from the atmosphere.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	221	Extreme weather events around the world – including flooding, droughts, wildfires, hurricanes and heatwaves – have continuously hit the news headlines.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	222	Thousands of people have been killed or displaced and economic losses are measured in the trillions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	223	Bearing witness to the increasingly clear signs of climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published the first report in its Sixth Assessment cycle addressing the “Physical Science Basis” in August 2021.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	224	Dubbed a “code red for humanity” by the United Nations Secretary-General, the IPCC report documents in far greater detail and with higher certainty than previous assessments how climate change and extreme events can be attributed to the build-up of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	225	Building on the new evidence from the IPCC, the twentysixth United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) is charged with the growing urgency of accelerating global ambition and action on both mitigation and adaptation.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	226	This coincides with an important milestone in the five-year ambition-raising cycle of the Paris Agreement, whereby countries were requested to submit new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that represent a progression compared with previous NDCs before COP26.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	227	There is therefore a special focus both in the international discussions and in this year's Emissions Gap Report on the ambition level in the new and updated NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	228	As the September 2021 version of the NDC Synthesis Report published by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) illustrates, the new and updated NDCs are insufficient to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 2021).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	229	It expands the analysis to consider new or updated NDCs and mitigation pledges that have been announced for 2030 and assesses the impacts of these on global emissions, the emissions gap and projected global warming at the end of the century.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	230	Furthermore, it provides an in-depth assessment of the netzero pledges that an increasing number of countries are committing to, including whether 2030 plans set countries on a clear path towards their longer-term net-zero pledges.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	231	This difference between where we will likely be and where we need to be is now well known as the ‘emissions gap’.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	232	This year, the new or updated NDCs as well as officially announced mitigation pledges for 2030, with a cut-off date of 30 September 2021, are included in the assessment.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	233	One of the United Kingdom’s key goals for its COP26 presidency is to secure global net zero by mid-century and keep 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	234	To date, 49 countries (50 parties, including the European Union) have firmly pledged net-zero emission goals by around mid-century, and a large number of nonstate actors have joined the High-Level Climate Champions in the Race To Zero campaign that aims to elevate ambition and mobilize credible climate action among cities, regions, businesses and investors.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	235	Given the increasing importance of and attention to net-zero emission pledges, the report includes a special chapter on net zero which assesses the trends in and robustness of these goals, including whether 2030 commitments set countries on a clear path towards their longer-term net-zero pledges.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	236	First, an updated assessment is provided on the extent to which COVID-19 fiscal recovery measures are used to accelerate a green transition.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	237	Second, the scope for reducing emissions from methane, the second largest GHG, to bridge the gap and get on track towards net zero is examined.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	238	Finally, the report looks into a key negotiation issue for COP26: reaching agreement on how to move forward with article 6 of the Paris Agreement dealing with cooperative approaches and market mechanisms.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	239	As in previous years, this 2021 Emissions Gap Report has been prepared by an international team consisting of 78 leading scientists from 44 expert institutions across 24 countries, assessing all available information, including that published in the context of the IPCC reports, as well as in other recent scientific studies.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	240	The transparent and participatory assessment process has been overseen by an experienced steering committee.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	241	All chapters have undergone external review and the assessment methodology and preliminary findings were made available to the governments of the countries specifically mentioned in the report in order to provide them with the opportunity to comment on the findings.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	242	The report is organized into seven chapters, including this introduction.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	243	Chapter 2 assesses the trends in global GHG emissions and how they are affected by COVID-19, and provides a global and G20-member-specific overview of new, updated and announced NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	244	Chapter 4 updates the assessment of the likely emissions gap in 2030, based on new or updated NDCs as well as officially announced mitigation pledges for 2030.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	245	The chapter then looks at the implications of the emissions gap on the feasibility of achieving the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	246	Chapter 5 assesses the extent to which COVID-19 fiscal rescue and recovery measures to date can support low-carbon or high-carbon development.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	247	It also looks at the disparities between high-income and developing countries.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	248	Chapter 6 assesses the role of methane in the NDCs and in bridging the emissions gap, and considers options for cost-effective reductions of the otherwise growing emissions of methane.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	249	Finally, chapter 7 looks at the potential role of market mechanisms in implementing NDCs and enhancing future ambitions, and discusses what is required to make the use of markets environmentally effective, transparent and credible.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	250	It also reviews progress towards implementing 2030 pledges, with a special focus on G20 members.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	251	It discusses the characteristics of these pledges (in aggregate) and assesses their impact 1 The members of the G20 are: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and the European Union.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	252	The assessment covers all individual G20 members and regions, except European Union member states.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	253	For this Emissions Gap Report, progress towards achieving the Cancun Pledges has not been assessed, due to the large uncertainty around 2020 emissions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	254	All GHG emission figures in this report are expressed using the 100-year global warming potentials (GWPs) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  4 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On Fourth Assessment Report,3 unless otherwise noted.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	255	The methodology and preliminary findings of this chapter were made available to the governments of the countries specifically mentioned to provide them with the opportunity to comment on the findings.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	256	These 2019 estimates of global GHG emissions have been downward adjusted compared with the Emissions Gap Report 2020, as more complete data have become available.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	257	However, a full switch to using Fifth Assessment Report GWPs in this report is not yet possible as the literature is still not up to date on this decision.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	258	Non-CO2 emissions were extrapolated to 2019 based on the Emissions Gap Report 2020.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	259	Different GHGs play different roles in the changes in total GHG emissions (figure 2.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	266	Based on the IEA and Carbon Monitor data, fossil CO2 emissions are expected to have a near full recovery in 2021, with emission levels only slightly lower than the record high in 2019.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	268	Despite the large decline in CO2 emissions in 2020, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere grew by around 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	269	It is unlikely that the reductions in emissions in 2020 will be detectible in the atmospheric growth rate for three reasons.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	270	First, although emission levels declined, they were still high and around the same levels as those seen in the early 2010s, meaning the amount of CO2 remaining in the atmosphere is expected to be only marginally less than if emissions grew.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	271	Second, CO2 is a cumulative pollutant with a long lifetime, so sustained emission reductions are needed to see a change in the atmospheric signal.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	272	Finally, the natural variability of around one part per million is far greater than the effect of a 5.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	273	Similar factors mean that methane and nitrous oxide concentrations also continued to grow in line with trends, with the increase in these concentrations in 2020 the highest ever recorded.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	274	The lack of change in atmospheric concentrations despite a record drop in emissions highlights that solving the climate problem requires rapid and sustained reductions in emissions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	275	As at 30 September 2021,5 121 parties (including the European Union and its 27 member states, which submit a single NDC), representing around 52 per cent of 2018 global domestic GHG emissions (Climate Watch 2021), had submitted 94 new or updated NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	276	The NDCs communicated thus far reflect emerging trends related to the ambition, form, coverage and  7 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On conditionality of GHG mitigation pledges, as well as the expected use of market mechanisms in their achievement.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	277	Effect on 2030 emissions: Of the 94 new or updated NDCs, just under half (46 NDCs from countries representing 32 per cent of global GHG emissions) would result in lower 2030 emissions relative to the previous NDCs (figure 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	278	Eighteen per cent (17 NDCs from countries representing 6 These figures include only those countries that have submitted new or updated NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	279	Thirty-four per cent (32 NDCs from countries representing 7 per cent of global emissions) could not be compared with the previous NDCs in terms of 2030 emissions, typically due to insufficient information in the previous NDCs, as transparency has improved in the current NDCs.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	281	Base-year targets typically (though not always) result in emissions decreasing over time relative to historical levels, whereas baseline scenario targets are typically (though not always) formulated to allow absolute emissions to continue to grow.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	282	The form of GHG targets in new or updated NDCs evolved relative to the previous round, with a slightly larger share of NDCs now setting base-year targets (from 19 per cent to 28 per cent of NDCs).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	283	Most countries adopting a GHG target for the first time in their new or updated NDC adopted a baseline scenario target.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	284	Sector and gas coverage: GHG targets can be formulated to cover a country’s entire economy or only a subset of it.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	285	Targets with full coverage include the energy, industrial process and product use, waste and land sectors, as well as CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorochemicals (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	286	The GHG targets in the current round of NDCs are only marginally more comprehensive in terms of sector and gas coverage than in the previous round.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	287	Of the new or updated NDCs, 19 per cent had full sector and gas coverage, up from 14 per cent in those countries’ first NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	288	While  8 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On seven countries improved their NDCs from partial coverage to full or nearly full coverage, three countries downgraded their NDCs from nearly full coverage to partial coverage.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	289	Conditionality: Some parties have submitted NDCs that are entirely or partially conditional on factors such as international support (e.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	290	This round of NDCs includes more unconditional elements than the last round, with 26 per cent completely unconditional, up from 24 per cent in countries’ first contributions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	291	This was largely due to countries making any mixed conditional and unconditional elements completely unconditional in their new or updated NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	292	Likewise, the share of completely conditional NDCs fell from 31 per cent to 18 per cent.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	293	Finally, parties are increasingly recognizing gender integration as a means to enhance the ambition and effectiveness of their climate action in their new or updated NDCs (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] 2021).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	294	The analysis is based on the difference in projected GHG emissions by 2030 under the full implementation of the new or updated NDC submissions and announced pledges compared with the previous NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	295	If the announced pledges of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea are included, this reduction increases to 4.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	296	The two open-source tools that provide NDC emissions projections for many countries are: Climate Resource (Meinshausen et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	297	All GHG emissions projections of the Climate Action Tracker and Climate Resource exclude LULUCF.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	298	Climate Action Tracker accounts for the impact of the announcements of China and Japan, Joint Research Centre for China and Japan, and PBL for the impact of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	299	Six G20 members have formally submitted updated NDCs with enhanced GHG mitigation pledges: Argentina, Canada, the EU27 (counting the EU27 and its three individual G20 member states France, Germany and Italy as one), South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States of America – all of which entail reduced emissions in 2030 of about 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	300	Two G20 members (Brazil and Mexico) have submitted targets that lead to an increase in emissions of 0.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	301	In addition, China, Japan and the Republic of Korea have announced enhanced pledges that result in annual reductions of about 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	302	The largest reductions come from the United States of America, the EU27, the United Kingdom, Argentina and Canada (submitted), and China and Japan (announced).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	303	Two G20 members (Australia and Indonesia) have submitted NDC targets, which are assessed not to lead to an additional reduction relative to the previous NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	304	One G20 member (the Russian Federation) has submitted an NDC that improves upon its previous NDC, but still does not go beyond its current policies and another three G20 members (India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey) have not yet submitted a new or updated NDC (table 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	305	Non-G20 members In comparison, the aggregate impact of the new or updated NDC submissions for the non-G20 members is an annual reduction of about 0.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	306	As explained previously, for some countries, NDC emission levels are expected to be above the estimated current policies scenario, with the projections of the current policies scenario assumed for the global emissions estimate.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	307	Due to the impact on COVID-19 on GHG emissions projections under the current policies scenario, the emissions projections of many countries have lowered.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	308	This means that a larger number of countries are expected to overachieve their NDC targets, in particular India, the Russian Federation and Turkey, which lowers global GHG emissions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	309	In addition, the methodology of the underlying models may have also been updated, which could lead to changes in global emissions estimates between scenarios.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	310	Both NDCs present the same reduction target of 43 per cent by 2030 below 2005 emission levels.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	311	Brazil’s NDC emissions (and therefore the absolute emissions in the NDC scenario) vary a great deal due to revisions of the 2005 base year.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	312	The country’s second and third inventory reports and Fourth National Communication (its latest) give different values.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	313	The first NDC refers to the second inventory report, while the updated NDC cites the 2005 base year emissions of the third inventory report (Fifth Assessment Review metrics), but also specifies that “information on emissions in 2005 and reference values may be updated and recalculated due to methodological improvements applicable to the inventories” (Brazil 2020).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	314	The updated NDC of December 2020 provided an indicative emissions budget of 4,832–4,764 MtCO2e.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	315	There is no study available yet that compares the ambition of the new 2030 target with the previous NDC.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	316	Sources: Climate Watch (2021) 10 For comparison with the updated NDC, modelling studies interpolate the previous 2025 and 2050 targets (80 per cent from 2005 levels).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	317	As the withdrawal of the United States of America from the Paris Agreement took effect on 4 November 2020, the country no longer had an official NDC in 2020.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	318	The calculated impact of the updated NDC relative to the current policies scenario would therefore be a reduction of about 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	319	Projections of the current policies scenario assume that no additional mitigation policies and measures are taken beyond those adopted and/or implemented as of a certain cut-off date (den Elzen et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	320	This report’s assessment is based on ‘point-in-time’ emissions projections in the NDC target year.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	322	Official assessments published by national governments were compared with independent assessments.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	323	The progress assessment was based on emissions figures including land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF; see appendix A on how the emissions projections excluding LULUCF were adjusted).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	324	Recently published emissions projections for the current policies scenario and NDC scenario were collected from independent studies and considered.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	325	As at October 2021, only a few of the institutions regularly publishing national-level CO2 and GHG emissions projections for the current policies scenario had released updates that considered the potential impact of COVID-19.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	326	Annually published global studies, such as Climate Action Tracker (2021b), Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (Joint Research Centre 2021) and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (Nascimento et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	327	For these studies, the progress assessment 12 Current policy scenario projections assume that no additional mitigation action is taken beyond current policies, even if it results in NDC targets not being achieved or being overachieved (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2015; den Elzen et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	328	Current policies scenario projections reflect all adopted and implemented policies, which for the purpose of this report are defined as legislative decisions, executive orders or their equivalent.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	329	This implies that officially announced plans or strategies alone would not qualify, while individual executive orders to implement such plans or strategies would qualify.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	330	Other recent studies included several new national model scenarios from Fragkos et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	331	These studies updated some 2020 national model scenario projections from the European Horizon 2020 Linking Climate and Development Policies – Leveraging International Networks and Knowledge Sharing (CD-LINKS) project (Roelfsema et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	332	However, it should be noted that these scenarios did not include the impact of COVID-19.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	333	After examining the projections from the studies collected, a number of pre-2020 studies were excluded whose 2020 emission estimates were more than 10 per cent higher than the highest estimates of the three studies published in 2021 that considered the impact of COVID-19 and recent policies (Climate Action Tracker 2021b; Joint Research Centre 2021; Nascimento et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	334	Up-to-date official emissions projections published since November 2020 were collected from various sources, including countries’ recently published national communications and biennial update reports, and other national government reports (see appendix A).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	335	Such information included annually updated projections made by the Australian and Canadian governments (Australia, Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources 2020; Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada 2021).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	336	The most important limitation for the 2021 assessment is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the current policies scenario projections.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	337	As at September 2021, several recent projections had either been published or prepared prior to the pandemic, and therefore did not account for its potentially significant impact on emission trends in 2020 and 2021, and in the period until 2030.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	338	Other important limitations are similar to those of previous Emissions Gap Reports (see appendix A).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	339	Similarly, G20 members are projected to collectively fall short of their previous unconditional NDCs (as at November 2020) by 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	340	However, the G20 members are collectively expected to slightly overachieve their previous unconditional NDCs by about 0.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	341	Ten of 1714 G20 members are likely to achieve their unconditional NDC targets based on previous or first NDC submissions under current policies (i.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	343	Arabia, South Africa, Turkey and the United Kingdom – as a former European Union member state; see table 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	344	Three G20 members (India, the Russian Federation and Turkey) are projected to be at least 15 per cent lower than their previous unconditional emission target levels and therefore have significant room to increase the ambition of their NDCs (figure 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	345	Central estimates of emissions projections for 2030 under current policies were lower than those of the Emissions Gap Report 2020 for all previously mentioned G20 members, with the exception of Argentina, whose estimate remained largely unchanged.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	346	For example, for the EU27 and South Africa, current projections are roughly 10 per cent and 20 per cent lower than the projections of last year’s assessment, respectively, due to enhanced policies and the impact of COVID-19.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	347	The number of independent studies that project a country to meet its previous or first NDC target were compared with the total number of studies and are indicated in square brackets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	348	Current policies scenario projections were also examined from official publications.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	349	The number of official publications that projected countries would achieve their point-in-time NDC target were: Australia: 0 of 1, Canada: 0 of 1, EU27: 0 of 1, Russian Federation: 0 of 1 and the United Kingdom: 0 of 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	350	The EU Reference Scenario was used for the EU27, which assumes full implementation of the national energy and climate plans by European Union member states and sees European Union emissions reduce by around 43 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030 (European Commission 2021).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	351	Including net removals from LULUCF increases the reduction to 45 per cent.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	352	This baseline scenario indicates that additional effort would be required to meet the European Union’s current 2030 energy-efficiency target, though its current 2030 renewable energy target would be met.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	353	Additional measures for member states are being prepared to fully implement national energy and climate plans submitted in 2020 (European Commission 2020).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	354	The Republic of Korea’s Emissions Trading Scheme (K-ETS) is an instrument used to fully achieve the country’s NDC target and covers about 70 per cent of its GHG emissions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	355	Among the three independent studies, only one (PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency) explicitly quantified the impact of the K-ETS up to 2025 based on the Master Plans for K-ETS Phase III (2021–2025) and Phase IV (2026–2030) and the Phase III National Allowances Allocation Plan.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	356	This partially explains why the studies project that the Republic of Korea will miss its NDC target under current policies.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	357	For China, four out of six independent studies projected that the country would achieve its original NDC target.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	358	However, since five of the six studies reviewed only provided a single NDC target value for 2030 – despite China’s NDC containing multiple targets, which are partly dependent on GDP growth rates – it was not possible to analyse in detail which targets would likely be met or overachieved.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	359	The long-term impacts of COVID-19 on GHG emissions were also highly uncertain, especially given the fact that China’s fossil CO2 emissions rebounded strongly in the second half of 2020 and in 2021 (section 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	360	This stronger-than-expected rebound was not considered in China’s latest emissions projections that estimated the impact of COVID-19 (Climate Action Tracker (2021b), Joint Research Centre (2021) and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (2021)).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	361	Six G20 members’ GHG emissions were projected to fall short and therefore require further action of varying degree to meet their previous (or original) unconditional NDC targets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	362	These G20 members are Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	363	Australia is also projected to miss its emissions budget targets for 2021–2030 without relying on past overachievement (Australia, Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources 2020).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	364	However, the official projections also indicated that Australia would achieve its point-in-time NDC target if its Technology Investment Roadmap is fully implemented (‘High technology’ scenario) (Australia, Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources 2020).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	365	The central estimate for the country’s 2030 emissions in this year’s assessment decreased by about 0.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	366	The main reasons for this result include the exclusion of two projections developed with a 2017 cut-off date for policies (Chai et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	367	It is worth noting that Canada and the United States of America have strengthened their NDC targets, though independent studies suggest that they are not on track to meet their earlier NDC targets with implemented policies.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	368	Although positive trends have been observed as described previously, these two countries need to make significant additional efforts to meet their new NDC targets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	369	Independent studies either do not agree or are inconclusive on whether Indonesia is on track to meet its unconditional NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	370	This is mainly due to the uncertainty of LULUCF emissions projections as a result of peat fires.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	371	The central estimate for 2030 emissions in this year’s assessment are higher than that of the 2020 assessment, partially due to the major revision of LULUCF emissions data and projections.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	372	The aggregate emissions for G20 members in 2030 under current policies are projected to be about 2 GtCO2e lower than that of the 2020 assessment.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	373	Consideration of 2020 emission reductions and the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the global economy has contributed significantly to the lower emissions projections.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	374	Another key factor behind these estimated lower emissions is the impact of policies adopted by G20 members in recent years, which will affect their progress towards achieving their NDC targets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	375	Many of these policies were adopted after the publication of the scenario studies reviewed in this section.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	376	Although there have been many positive developments, there have also been several negative ones, such as the implementation of fossil fuel extraction projects and coal-fired power plant construction plans, as well as the rollback of environmental regulations during the pandemic.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	377	Based on the central estimates of independent studies, several G20 members, namely Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Russian Federation and Saudi Arabia, are expected to emit more emissions in 2030 than they did in 2010 under implemented policies.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	385	However, compared with 2010 levels, average emissions are not expected to be lower and as the figure illustrates they are still far off the median estimates consistent with 2°C and 1.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	392	Emissions reductions are essential to keep the challenge of halting global warming as manageable as possible.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	393	Removals are used to balance out emissions from activities for which we have not reduced emissions to zero – hence the concept of ‘net zero’ – as well as to deliver net-negative global emissions that can gradually reverse the warming already caused.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	394	One promising development is the announcement of longterm net-zero emissions pledges by an increasing number of countries that currently account for more than half of global emissions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	395	However, these pledges have large ambiguities and few of the latest nationally determined contributions (NDCs) put countries on a clear path towards their net-zero pledges.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	396	There is an urgent need to back net-zero pledges up with near-term targets and actions that give confidence that net-zero emissions can ultimately be achieved.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	397	This chapter looks at how net-zero emissions targets have emerged from the scientific understanding of the climate system and the goals of the Paris Agreement (section 3.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	398	It sets out the considerations when translating net zero from a global scientific concept to national policy targets (section 3.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	399	Net-zero emissions targets are being defined in a variety of ways – the most important aspect from a global geophysical perspective being whether they cover all GHGs or carbon dioxide (CO2) only (Rogelj et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	400	Net-zero GHG emissions are achieved when total aggregate GHG emissions over a given period are equal to an equivalent amount of aggregate GHG removal (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] 2021b).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	401	Other terms such as ‘carbon neutrality’ and ‘climate neutrality’ are often used interchangeably for net-zero CO2 and net-zero GHG emissions, respectively.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	402	However, as their meaning can differ depending on context and language, further specification is needed to avoid ambiguity (see glossary for various definitions of net-zero terms).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	403	The concept gained traction after several scientific studies in the 2000s established a near-linear relationship between global warming and the total amount of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions ever emitted.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	404	Reaching net-zero CO2 emissions results in CO2 concentrations gradually declining over time towards a long-term equilibrium as part of the excess CO2 in the atmosphere is redistributed by the uptake in the biosphere on land and in the ocean.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	405	The most recent IPCC assessment report (the Sixth Assessment Report, AR6) confirms that warming is expected to stabilize once global CO2 emissions reach net-zero levels (IPCC 2021a; Lee et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	406	For non-CO2 emissions, the global temperature impact of achieving net-zero emissions depends on how long the GHG persists in the atmosphere (Pierrehumbert 2014; Solomon et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	407	Methane, currently the second-largest contributor to warming, has a much shorter lifetime than CO2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	408	Therefore, if methane emissions reduce to zero, concentrations fall faster, and their contribution to global temperature will decline.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	409	Achieving net-zero GHG emissions expressed with the default GWP-100 metric through a combination of low 1 Parties to the Paris Agreement are mandated to report aggregated greenhouse gas emissions by using the GWP-100 metric, while additional information that uses other aggregations can also be provided.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	410	Note that in addition, emissions of the various GHGs also have to be reported individually.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	411	The magnitude of this decline depends on the minimum level to which non-CO2 GHGs can be reduced, but could potentially be around 0.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	412	At present, none of the available mitigation scenarios fully eliminate all CO2 or other GHG emissions (Clarke et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	413	To reach net-zero emissions, residual emissions are thus balanced by removals from the atmosphere: hence the inclusion of ‘net’ in net-zero targets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	414	The most scalable forms of GHG removal are CO2 removal measures (Fuss et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	415	This means that net-zero CO2 emissions are achieved before net-zero GHG emissions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	416	Reaching net-zero GHG emissions targets therefore involves at least two, and in most cases three, interlinked strategies: deep reductions in CO2 emissions, the upscaling of CO2 removal, and deep reductions in other GHG emissions (figure 3.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	417	Carbon budgets Global warming is close to linearly proportional to the total net amount of CO2 that has ever been emitted into the atmosphere as a result of human activities.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	418	Therefore, limiting global warming to a specified level requires that the total amount of CO2 emissions ever emitted be kept within a finite carbon budget.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	419	Recently, AR6 published new estimates of the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	420	According to these, human activities resulted in about 2,390 GtCO2 between 1850 and 2019, contributing around three quarters of the 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	421	Current annual global CO2 emissions are above 40 GtCO2/year, meaning that urgent and deep emissions reductions over the next decade are required to stay within the remaining budgets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	422	For methane, this implies at least a 30 per cent reduction in 2030 compared with 2010, and about a 50 per cent reduction in 2050.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	423	Remaining carbon budgets may vary by an estimated 220 GtCO2 or more, depending on how deeply future non-carbon-dioxide emissions are reduced (Canadell et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	424	Chapter 6 assesses the role of methane in meeting these emissions reductions and bridging the emissions gap.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	425	Although several different metrics for defining this equivalence exist (Myhre et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	426	Illustration of how net-zero carbon dioxide or net-zero greenhouse gas emissions are reached at a global level (top) and the typical global warming implications of reaching these respective targets (bottom) Figure 3.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	429	Reaching net-zero CO2 emissions results in global warming stabilizing, provided that non-CO2 forcing is also stabilized (Allen et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	430	Note that this figure shows one illustrative scenario in which the net-zero timings of CO2 and total GHG emissions are not necessarily equal to the median estimates of the IPCC Special Report on global warming of 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	431	The Paris Agreement marked the incorporation of the net-zero concept into international policy, aiming to “achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty” (UNFCCC 2015).

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	434	In the pathway categories as used in chapter 4 of this report, pathways with emissions reductions before 2020 are excluded.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	435	The temperature outcomes of these pathways have also been reassessed based on the physical climate assessment of the IPCC AR6 – see cross-chapter box 7.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	436	Whether we follow a linear, an accelerated, or a delayed path impacts the climate outcome (figure 3.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	437	Following a delayed path compared to an accelerated path to net-zero GHG emissions by 2065 could lead to about 0.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	438	At worst, a delay could result in a complete failure to achieve the net-zero target, resulting in higher warming.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	439	Near-term emissions reductions that sketch a linear or accelerated path towards a longer-term net-zero target therefore provide higher confidence that the net-zero target can ultimately be achieved.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	441	Additional cumulative emissions leading to higher warming, higher mitigation challenges, and greater difficulty in achieving the net-zero target on a linear path, or on an accelerated path.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	442	Linear: the NDC sets emissions approximately on a linear path towards achieving the net-zero target.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	443	Delayed: the NDC reduces emissions more slowly than implied by a linear path towards the net-zero target.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	444	Cumulative emissions and resulting global warming are higher compared to a linear path.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	445	Global net-zero emissions targets in isolation set only a weak limit on the maximum level of global warming (Rogelj et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	446	These steps represent both technical choices and normative decisions related to equity and fairness.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	447	Although this chapter focuses on countries, there are similar steps to translate global net-zero targets to sectors, companies, investment portfolios and other entities (see box 3.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	448	First, at a technical level, the scope of emissions covered by a net-zero target needs defining (Levin et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	449	For countries, the UNFCCC's requirement that parties report emissions and removals of a basket of GHGs on a territorial basis informs the scope of national targets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	450	Countries could however exclude some gases or activities, include others such as international aviation and shipping, or take a different approach such as consumption-based accounting (Davis and Caldeira 2010; Munksgaard and Pedersen 2001; Wyckoff and Roop 1994).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	451	These credits are transferred to be accounted for within the boundary, often – but not always – by financial purchase through a market.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	452	Markets can allow entities to meet targets in a more economically efficient way (Grubb et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	453	However, experience shows that international carbon markets can have pitfalls.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	454	Large numbers of creditgenerating projects in the Clean Development Mechanism – the market operated under the Kyoto Protocol – were found not to fully represent additional carbon benefits  23 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On (Cames et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	455	The Paris Agreement anticipates a new international regime for carbon markets under article 6, the operation of which is still under negotiation.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	456	This will require clearly defined rules and robust accounting mechanisms to track progress, deliver real emissions reductions and drive ambition.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	457	Chapter 7 further discusses challenges and opportunities in using markets in achieving Paris Agreement targets in both the near-term and net-zero context.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	458	Second, normative choices are required when translating global net-zero targets to the country level, involving questions of equity and fairness.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	459	Factors such as responsibility, capacity and level of development imply that some nations should achieve (and go beyond) net-zero emissions more quickly than others (Dubash et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	460	Furthermore, the costs of and potential for achieving emissions reductions and removals are geographically unevenly distributed.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	461	Reaching global net-zero emissions is therefore likely to involve a combination of positive and negative emissions contributions across countries and sectors, keeping in mind that the global potential for negative CO2 emissions is limited because of technical, social and sustainability reasons (IPCC 2019, 2018).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	462	This variation between countries is illustrated by the different times at which regions (Rogelj 2018) or major emitting countries (van Soest et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	463	Aside from questions of equity and scope, debates have emerged over whether net-zero targets promote or hinder actions consistent with the Paris Agreement.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	464	Net-zero is seen as more actor-centred and effective than a temperature limit (Geden 2016).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	465	It also represents greater ambition than the current long-term pledges of most countries.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	466	Other critics highlight that a narrow focus on net-zero targets can lose sight of differences in national climate politics, or the credibility of pledges, as well as equity (Dubash et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	467	Net-zero targets are not to be viewed in isolation as the sole policy mechanism for effecting change; they should be accompanied by near-term actions as well as detailed and transparent plans for delivery (Rogelj et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	468	The Paris Agreement encourages these through the submission of NDCs and long-term strategies to the UNFCCC.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	469	In response to these issues and criticisms, several recent studies have focused on identifying a set of criteria against which the robustness of net-zero pledges can be assessed (Black et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	470	Overview of criteria used to assess national net-zero pledges Studies Climate Action Tracker (2021) Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit – Oxford (Black et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	471	By the broadest definition, as many as 136 countries covering more than half of global GHG emissions either have some form of commitment to such a target or are considering it (Climate Action Tracker 2021; Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit [ECIU] 2021; UNEP 2020; World Resources Institute 2020).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	472	This includes countries whose governments are merely discussing net-zero targets, and signatories to the Climate Ambition Alliance which cites working towards net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 among its aims (Climate Ambition Alliance 2019).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	473	We include references to net-zero emissions, net-zero carbon, carbon neutral(ity), GHG neutral(ity), climate neutral(ity) and a decarbonized economy or society.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	474	Using this classification, 52 parties (51 countries plus the European Union) have pledged a net-zero target.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	475	These cover around 57 per cent of current global domestic GHG emissions, 60 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and 34 per cent of the global population (Climate Watch 2021; World Resources Institute 2021).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	476	Thirteen targets are enshrined in law, covering 12 per cent of global emissions (table 3.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	477	Eight targets are aimed at earlier years (2030–2045) and four at later years.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	478	In terms of emissions, however, the targets are split almost entirely and equally between 2050 (due to the pledges by the European Union and United States of America) and 2060 (due to China’s pledge).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	479	It is important to note that approaches to counting carbon sources and sinks can differ between global studies and national reporting.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	480	Some care is therefore needed when assigning net-zero status to countries, or interpreting claims by countries that ‘carbon neutrality’ has been achieved.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	481	In particular, national GHG inventories label all carbon uptake on managed land (including naturally occurring uptake) as anthropogenic, resulting in greater removal numbers than in the scientific modelling studies that form the basis for the global emissions pathways assessed in chapter 4 of this report (Grassi et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	482	However, one available study indicates that differences between the two approaches at the global level lead to a negligible difference in terms of timing of net-zero emissions (Grassi et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	483	Existing net-zero targets show variations in scope, as well as large ambiguities (World Resources Institute 2020).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	484	Thirtysix are clear in including all sectors of domestic activity, while the remaining 16 are unclear or undecided.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	485	Regarding inclusion of GHGs, 17 targets are unclear or undecided, however those that are clear all include at least some nonCO2 gases as well as CO2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	486	The majority (41) are unclear or undecided on inclusion of emissions from international aviation and shipping.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	487	Similarly, on use of offsets, five include them explicitly, eight rule them out and 39 are unclear or undecided.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	488	As already explained, achieving net-zero emissions is key to halting or even gradually reversing global warming.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	489	With an increasing share of global emissions covered by netzero targets, their impact on temperature projections is also increasingly important.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	490	Chapter 4 – which provides an overview of global warming implications of current policies, NDCs and net-zero targets – estimates that if fully achieved, net-zero targets could reduce global warming projections by about 0.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	491	All are for the year 2050, with the exception of China’s 2060 target and Germany’s target for 2045.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	492	Where information relevant to the criteria is available from countries, figure 3.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	493	For instance, a plan may be published and it may refer to the fairness of its contribution to global efforts, however additional assessment is required to establish whether the plan is detailed enough and the fairness appropriate.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	494	Similar to the global assessment of national net-zero targets, a notable feature of current net-zero targets of G20 members is their ambiguity.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	495	Regarding scope, most targets are unclear or undecided on inclusion of offsets and of international aviation and shipping emissions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	496	Lack of clarity is also notable on coverage of sectors and gases, but those that are clear show a tendency for comprehensive coverage.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	497	Most show a lack of transparency regarding the approach taken to fairness, the plans for achievement (including on use of removals), and on reporting and reviewing progress.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	498	Only Canada, the European Union, France, Germany and the Republic of Korea have published their plans so far, and only these countries plus the United Kingdom have accountable processes for reviewing their targets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	499	As an indication of the consistency between nearer-term actions and net-zero targets, figure 3.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	500	Indeed, the Emissions Gap Report 2020 (UNEP 2020) argued that the litmus test of net-zero pledges is the extent to which they are reflected in near-term policy action and in significantly more ambitious NDCs for the period to 2030.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	501	Near-term emissions reductions that follow a linear or accelerated path towards a net-zero target provide higher confidence that the net-zero target can be achieved.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	502	To summarize, eight G20 members have so far not set netzero targets, whereas 12 (covering 54 per cent of global domestic GHG emissions) have.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	503	Of the nine G20 members for which we can estimate an emissions path based on their net-zero target and their NDC, none have NDC targets that put them on an accelerated path towards their net-zero emissions targets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	504	Five of these nine members (covering 21 per cent of global domestic GHG emissions) have NDC targets that put the country’s domestic emissions onto a linear path towards achieving their net-zero targets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	505	For four G20 members (covering 28 per cent of global domestic GHG emissions), the NDCs lead to emissions in 2030 that are about 25 per cent to 95 per cent higher than a linear path towards their net-zero targets would imply.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	506	These countries urgently need strengthened and more ambitious near-term climate plans for their net-zero targets to remain achievable.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	507	There is an urgent need for (i) more G20 members – and indeed all countries – to pledge net-zero emissions, (ii) all countries to increase the robustness of their net-zero pledges, and (iii) all net-zero targets to be backed up by nearterm actions that give confidence that the net-zero targets can ultimately be achieved.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	509	Member states of the European Union have no separate assessment of their path to net zero, because their NDC is not assessed separately as part of this report.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	510	Non-state action on net zero Businesses, cities, regions, investors, civil society groups, and other non-state and subnational actors (NSAs) play an increasingly important role in raising ambition and accelerating implementation.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	511	The Paris Agreement institutionalized the engagement of NSAs in achieving long-term climate goals and created an ongoing process to catalyse climate commitments made by NSAs, including net-zero targets (Chan, Ellinger and Widerberg 2018; Hale 2016; Hsu et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	512	Efforts by NSAs towards global net-zero emissions are strengthening and broadening, which helps mobilize stakeholders to achieve net zero (Data-Driven EnviroLab and NewClimate Institute 2020; Hsu et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	513	The United Nations Race To Zero campaign rallies NSAs globally to take rigorous actions to reduce emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 at the latest, vetting members via an independent expert group.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	514	More than 3,000 businesses, 730 cities, 170 investors, 30 regions and 600 universities have joined Race To Zero, together covering around 25 per cent of global CO2 emissions and 50 per cent of GDP (Black et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	515	Actions taken by NSAs can also contribute to achieving net-zero targets set by governments, while at the same time creating more favourable conditions for governments to increase their ambition going forward.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	516	At the national level, NSAs are supporting implementation and enhancement of climate goals.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	517	For instance, America Is All In, a coalition of over 1,800 institutions representing 65 per cent of the United States of America’s population and 70 per cent of its GDP, is an initiative to enhance nonstate actions to cut the United States of America’s GHG emissions by 50 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and put the country on a trajectory consistent with limiting global temperature rise to 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	518	Meanwhile, the European Commission launched the European Climate Pact to mobilize NSAs and communities to participate in climate actions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	519	The Japan Climate Initiative, made up of businesses and municipalities, has played a key role in supporting the government’s new NDC.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	520	However, the increase in NSA net-zero pledges needs to be treated with caution, because as they have proliferated, they have varied in robustness.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	521	The scope and coverage of net-zero targets; the existence of implementation plans, transparency and reporting to track progress; the alignment between near-term actions and long-term netzero targets; and the robustness of carbon offsets are critical to credible net-zero targets (Black et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	522	For example, the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, a private-sector-led initiative, aims to develop a threshold standard to ensure high integrity offset credits and create robust and transparent markets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	523	This year, the update of the emissions gap is particularly interesting as it is the first time countries have submitted new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) as part of the Paris Agreement’s five-year ambition-raising cycle.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	524	Thus, the update of the emissions gap provides an indication of the extent to which the NDC process under the Paris Agreement is working and the progress made.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	525	To estimate the emissions gap, updated scenarios that underlie its quantification are assessed (section 4.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	526	This year, the mitigation pledge scenarios include the latest available NDCs as well as announced mitigation pledges for 2030 with a cut-off date of 30 August 2021.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	527	Further, scenarios consider the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic and possible economic recovery paths.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	528	In this context, the key questions assessed in this chapter are: What is our current best estimate of the emissions gap for 2030 taking into account the new or updated NDCs, announced pledges and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated recovery measures? What are the global warming implications over the course of the century? 4.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	529	Summary of assessed scenarios Scenario Cut-off year Description Reference Year 2010 policies 2010 This scenario includes only climate polices implemented up to 2010 (no additional measures from 2010 onward).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	530	Current policies 2020/21 Current policies updated to reflect climate mitigation policies adopted and implemented as of 2020/21.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	531	Scenario also adjusted to reflect short- and midterm socioeconomic impacts from COVID-19.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	532	The year 2010 policies scenario assumes that no additional climate mitigation policies are implemented after 2010.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	533	As in previous gap reports, global GHG emissions in this scenario are based on the baseline projections of Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios from six modelling studies assuming middle-of-the-road socioeconomic assumptions (SSP2) (Fricko et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	534	The data for this scenario are based on updates by four modelling studies3 that include the impacts of COVID-19 and have a cut-off date of November 2020 and four international modelling groups.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	535	They are included to ensure consistency of the data set and methodology across the Emissions Gap Reports.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	536	Their results were adjusted to reflect updates of policies until November 2020 by comparing them to the results of the four modelling studies that provide estimates for both cutoff dates (den Elzen, Höhne and Jiang 2017).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	537	Following this approach, the median estimate of the impact of recent policies is a reduction in global GHG emissions of 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	538	To capture the impact of COVID-19, the four international modelling groups' estimates were adjusted based on three of the four modelling studies (Climate Action Tracker, International Energy Agency [IEA] and PBL) that provide global GHG emissions projections based on consistent current policies scenarios, including as well as excluding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	539	Following this approach, the impact of COVID-19 is an estimated reduction in global GHG emissions of about 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	540	Considering both of these impacts, the median estimate of global GHG emissions in 2 From the CD-LINKS Scenario Database, version 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	541	The more-optimistic stated policies scenario of the IEA World Energy Outlook 2020 that was used as a current policies scenario is not yet included.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	542	Furthermore, the energy-related CO2 emissions of IEA were supplemented with the median estimates of the non-CO2 GHG emissions and CO2 land-use-related emissions of the current policies scenarios from the COMMIT database.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	543	It remains critically important to understand the potential structural changes of the COVID-19 pandemic and the post-COVID rescue and recovery packages on emission levels out to 2030 (see chapter 5).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	544	This is particularly important given the use of 2030 as a target year in many countries’ NDC submissions and as a benchmark to gauge global climate action.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	545	Research is ongoing in this area, but not yet published in the peer-reviewed literature.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	546	While understanding of energy-related GHG emissions trends during the COVID-19 pandemic is improving (Forster et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	547	In 2020, agricultural activities had limited losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic and some commodities even increased their production (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] 2021a, 2021b; World Bank 2021).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	548	Further global deforestation rates increased significantly, resulting in a loss of tree cover by 25.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	549	Although near-term impacts on land-use dynamics are yet to be better known, as in the 2000s and 2010s, production of agricultural commodities (mainly beef, soy, and palm oil), illegal logging, mining extraction and wild fires were major drivers of deforestation (Curtis et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	550	The rising trend of prices for most food and metal commodities (FAO 2021a, 2021b; World Bank 2021), along with governmental stimulus into agribusiness activities, extractive industries, and development of road infrastructure in protected land regions drove deforestation and forest degradation, mainly in the tropics (Brancalion et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	551	During the COVID-19 crisis and due to limited financing resources, some governments have also relaxed environmental laws and decreased their national budgets of regulatory mechanisms, which has reduced the enforcement of environmental protection laws (Amador-Jiménez et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	552	Furthermore, national lockdowns and disruption of non-forest economic activities have limited the income of forest-dependent communities,  32 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On thereby increasing pressure on forest products (Golar et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	553	Another issue related to land-use emissions is that about half of the global scenarios analyses and national GHG inventories use different definitions for anthropogenic removals in the land-use sector, resulting in different amounts of net land-use carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions being reported, with a historic difference of up to 4 GtCO2e/year between national GHG inventories and global emission pathway studies (Grassi et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	554	The solutions that have been published to account and correct for this discrepancy are integrated in these studies by applying a constant adjustment term over the 2010– 2030 period.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	555	The estimated impact of revised reduction targets in the new or updated unconditional NDC submissions and announcements lowers the emissions projection of the unconditional NDC scenario by about 4 GtCO2e (about 15 per cent) compared with the previous NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	556	For the conditional NDC scenario including announced pledges, a similar impact is found.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	557	This results in a median estimate of global GHG emissions of 52 GtCO2e and 50 GtCO2e, if the unconditional and conditional NDCs are fully implemented.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	558	This is about 4 GtCO2e lower than last year’s projections (based on previous NDCs, see figure 4.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	559	The NDC and announced pledge scenario estimate is based on four model studies (Climate Action Tracker, PBL, JRC and Climate Resource) (Meinshausen et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	560	Previous reports already applied a similar adjustment method, when comparing model studies (such as the integrated assessment model studies) or in the emissions gap calculations.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	561	Although the literature now provides a more elaborate evidence base in support of this adjustment, this approach does not result in shifts in estimates of the global emissions gap.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	562	Here, we categorize emissions pathways from the literature based on their projected peak warming outcomes over the course of this century (Huppmann et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	563	We define three scenarios that differ in their estimated maximum warming over the course of this century (see table 4.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	564	This year, the scenarios have been updated by re-assessing their temperature outcomes based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report 6 Working Group I assessment.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	567	As pathways often assume netnegative CO2 emissions in the second half of the century, the estimated global warming in the year 2100 is typically lower than the maximum warming over the course of the twenty-first century.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	576	The current policies scenario is estimated to reduce global GHG emissions in 2030 to about 55 GtCO2e (52–58), which is 9 GtCO2e lower than in the year 2010 policies scenario.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	577	It is also 4 GtCO2e lower than the median estimate of the current policies scenario of the 2020 UNEP Emissions Gap Report.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	578	The implementation gap, which is the difference between emissions expected under the current policies scenario and those needed to achieve the NDCs and announced reduction pledges, is estimated to be 3 GtCO2e and 5 GtCO2e for the unconditional and conditional NDCs and pledge scenarios respectively.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	579	This is about 4 GtCO2e lower than the gap assessed in the 2020 report (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2020), due to the updated NDCs and announced reduction pledges.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	580	If the conditional NDCs and announced reduction pledges are also fully implemented, the emissions gap is further reduced by about 3 GtCO2e.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	581	The emissions gap between unconditional NDCs and announced reduction pledges and below 2°C pathways is about 13 GtCO2e (range: 10–16 GtCO2e), which is about 2 GtCO2e lower than last year.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	582	While NDC and announced mitigation pledges reduce global emissions by about 4 GtCO2e compared with previous NDCs, the updated 2°C scenario estimate for 2030 is about 2 GtCO2e lower than in previous Emissions Gap Reports (section 4.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	585	To understand how far off the mark current policies and NDCs are, estimated emissions for the year 2030 for each of these scenarios are projected out to 2100, and their climate outcomes assessed with a climate model (see box 4.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	586	This approach assumes a continuation of climate action beyond 2030 without additional strengthening.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	587	Extrapolations until the end of the century are inherently uncertain and subject to scenario assumptions such as the level at which climate action continues or technology costs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	588	This year, the method to extend emissions to 2100 and the climate model set up used was updated based on improved methods and the latest climate assessment of IPCC AR6 Working Group I.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	589	These updates alone result in temperature projections that are about 0.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	590	Taking the higher or lower end of the range surrounding the 2030 emissions estimates would lead to an additional increase or decrease in the temperature projections by about 0.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	591	Geophysical uncertainties in the climate response are reflected by the estimates for different warming percentiles (50 per cent, 66 per cent and 90 per cent).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	592	By contrast, a continuation of current policies, which are insufficient to meet the 2030 pledges, increase the estimates by about 0.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	593	Net-zero pledges, which have been announced by many countries (chapter 3), further lower these temperature estimates markedly by about 0.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	594	Sixty-six per cent, 50 per cent and 90 per cent percentile global warming projections of pathways assuming unconditional NDCs and net-zero targets would then become 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	595	Even with the implementation of current NDCs and all net-zero targets, there is still more than a 15 per cent chance that global warming will exceed 2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	596	Finally, these estimated improvements from net-zero targets should also be caveated by the fact that in many cases, current NDCs do not yet set countries’ emissions on a direct path towards reaching longer-term net-zero targets (see chapter 3).

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	603	Subsequently, the global warming outcome of each pathway is assessed with the reduced-complexity carboncycle and climate model MAGICC (Meinshausen et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	604	Countries’ net-zero targets, described and assessed in chapter 3, further bring down emissions projections over the course of this century (Höhne et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	605	The impact of this strengthening of climate action after 2030 is also estimated.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	606	This approach is an update compared to previous reports, both in terms of the method used to extend emissions to 2100 and the climate model set up used.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	607	If the NDC estimates of this report are assessed using last year’s methods, the temperature projections for unconditional NDCs would be about 0.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	631	Low-carbon conditionalities may require businesses to take environmental commitments as a condition of receiving public funds (or having a lower temporary tax or expense load).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	632	Since these measures incentivize innovation, they may increase the economic impact of taxpayer spending while also delivering environmental and social benefits (O’Callaghan and Hepburn 2020).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	633	Ongoing initiatives to improve comparative modelling methods also present a similar finding (Batini et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	634	Continental unions and regional economic commissions of the United Nations have highlighted similar priorities (see appendix B.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	635	Although the accessibility of these options depends on the development of technological infrastructure and the availability of natural and human resources, input-output modelling indicates that low-carbon investment could generate significantly more jobs and greater economic value than traditional ‘dirty’ and ‘neutral’ alternatives.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	636	Opportunities for reinforcement spending: The role of low-carbon reinforcement measures following recovery remains largely undiscussed in academic and professional literature.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	637	However, as COVID-19 spending becomes integrated intro regulatory budgetary processes, it becomes increasingly less distinguishable from normal ‘peacetime’ spending.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	638	Going forward, sustainability-proofing the entire budgetary process and increasing policy coherence across sectors and levels will be crucial to maximize the impact of a low-carbon recovery.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	639	This could be achieved through implementing green budget tagging processes (Eltokhy et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	640	Non-governmental and academic advisers collectively propose at least seven key principles for designing a lowcarbon fiscal response to the pandemic, as summarized in figure 5.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	641	Consensus opinion suggests that policy design should be consultative, evidence-based and gender-sensitive, while ensuring prompt implementation that is considerate of pandemic realities.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	642	Importantly, fiscal action represents only one of several mechanisms available to advance climate action and stimulate economic growth following COVID-19.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	643	Regulatory and market interventions, among others, can play a key role.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	644	To support accountability and transparency, low-carbon recovery investment of all kinds should include appropriate management structures for monitoring, reporting and verifying the effective implementation and use of recovery funds (Agrawala et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	645	Such measures may also improve understanding of the relative strengths of low-carbon fiscal investment over alternatives.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	647	Seven countries account for almost 90 per cent of this spending: China, France, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Spain and the United Kingdom (figure 5.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	648	The percentage of recovery spending that is low carbon has slowly increased since Emissions Gap Report 2020 (UNEP 2020), perhaps driven in part by a better understanding of the potential for low-carbon investments to deliver strong economic, environmental and social returns.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	649	The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Climate Action Tracker (CAT) have discontinued their trackers since the release of the 2020 Emissions Gap Report.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	650	The Greenness of Stimulus Index from Vivid Economics has changed its methodology, such that it no longer directly assesses policy-level climate impacts.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	651	Instead, the Greenness of Stimulus Index assigns a ‘greenness value’ (positive or negative) to each sector of every tracked country, with the final index for each country being an average of sectoral impact.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	652	As this methodology is not comparable with other trackers, Vivid Economics advised excluding the Greenness of Stimulus Index information from the figure.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	653	The IEA’s Sustainable Recovery Tracker and the Energy Policy Tracker only cover energy spending and are therefore excluded from this analysis.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	654	Many discrepancies between the included trackers relate to key differences in methodology: for instance, the Green Recovery Tracker (E3G undated) does not include certain types of rescue spending, while the Global Recovery Observatory (O’Callaghan et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	655	Trackers also vary in their definitions of ‘low-carbon’: one measure may receive a low-carbon tag by one tracker and a neutral tag by another, resulting in substantial differences in spending recorded in either category.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	656	Over 500 low-carbon rescue and recovery measures have been introduced worldwide, covering most emerging and established low-carbon industries (figure 5.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	657	The range of spending has been notably wider in advanced economies, with emerging market and developing economies focusing their low-carbon recovery funds on clean energy generation and natural capital investments.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	658	Spending on worker retraining initiatives remains low across countries, indicating an insufficient focus on long-term human capital development.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	659	The Greenness of Stimulus Index score is calculated by combining the flow of stimulus into five key sectors with an indicator of each sector’s environmental impact (Vivid Economics 2021).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	660	Some countries are already well into their economic recovery while others have been unable to act at all, constrained by low access to capital and continuing COVID-19 mobility restrictions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	661	Of those who have spent significantly, some have integrated green priorities to a considerable degree, with others having failed to consider environmental concerns in any way.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	662	The Global Recovery Observatory has found that Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany and Norway can be considered as ‘leaders’ in low-carbon recovery, with their low-carbon spending as a share of recovery spending ranging between 39 and 75 per cent.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	668	Foreign direct investment fell by 8 per cent in developing countries in 2020 compared with 14 Foreign direct investment refers to cross-border investment where an investor establishes lasting financial interest in and influence over an enterprise domiciled in another economy.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	669	Across both advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies, climate change is likely to expose some forms of debt to even more risk, particularly debt to finance climate-exposed investments such as agriculture (Dibley, Wetzer and Hepburn 2021; European Central Bank 2021).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	670	Without a substantial increase in foreign aid, the difference in spending between advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies will exacerbate gaps in development, while also restricting progress against climate change.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	671	Emerging market and developing economies are also likely to become the world’s top GHG emitters if climate finance does not significantly increase (World Resources Institute undated), all while disproportionately suffering the burden of climate change, which has historically been caused by high-income economies (see IMF 2021a).

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	674	Natural resource endowments in many low-income nations make investments in renewable energy generation facilities and natural capital solutions particularly attractive (Kim 2020).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	675	By prioritizing local supply chains, long-term partnerships between emerging market and developing economies and high-income economies can enable sustainable growth and build future-proof infrastructure.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	676	Wealthier economies could support vulnerable nations in several ways: ● Debt forgiveness Based on IMF and World Bank debt sustainability analysis, debt treatments, including debt write-offs, must be considered for vulnerable countries.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	677	Debt relief programmes, including debt-for-climate swaps, could help support lowcarbon recovery and a transition to low-carbon growth.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	678	Debt restructuring, including private debt, through new bond issuances aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement could help avert a ‘lost decade’ and provide fiscal resources for investment in a low-carbon recovery (Volz et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	679	Advanced economies can accelerate this by providing resources commensurate with the scale of the required transformation, i.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	680	Green and blue debt markets are growing in emerging market and developing economies, yet several challenges remain, including only a small pricing benefit of green and blue bonds over regular bonds (Doran and Tanner 2019; Otek Ntsama et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	681	Robust, standardized and stringent certification and monitoring systems could provide greater credibility for such issuances.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	682	Blended finance and partial guarantees have a key role in supporting this for emerging market and developing economies, particularly following the pandemic-induced crash in international project finance and other forms of foreign direct investment (UNCTAD 2021).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	683	On-lending a substantial amount of such funds to the world’s most vulnerable countries could significantly enhance the issuance.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	684	While the current IMF call for US$100 billion to be on-lent is positive, it remains insufficient given the extreme disparity in fiscal space between advanced and vulnerable economies.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	685	However, although such mechanisms are primarily intended as protective environmental measures, their unequal trade implications and potentially high burden on vulnerable nations must be acknowledged.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	686	If carbon border adjustment mechanisms are implemented, standards and controls must be developed that both support global environmental needs and development priorities of vulnerable nations.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	687	These mechanisms (and their standards and controls) must be implemented with significant financial and technical resources to support capacity-building in vulnerable nations (see Gore 2021).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	688	To ensure a successful sustainable and inclusive transition, emerging market and developing countries require significant technology transfer and capacity-building in addition to financial support, needs that should be reflected in updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	689	Support for low-carbon recovery in emerging market and developing economies often relies directly on the nation’s demonstrated interest to pursue public policy reforms that are consistent with the Paris Agreement goals, such as, for example, consideration of and action on carbon pricing, fossil fuel subsidies reform, green budgeting systems and regulations for financial sector greening.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	690	Along with black carbon, tropospheric ozone and some hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), methane is a short-lived climate pollutant (SLCP), a class that has much greater warming impacts per ton than CO2, but a much shorter atmospheric residence time.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	691	Atmospheric observations show that emission growth rates have accelerated over the past 15 years, with methane atmospheric concentrations reaching 1,879 parts per billion in 2020 on annual average, which was 6 per cent higher than in 2000 (Dlugokencky undated) and 260 per cent higher than during pre-industrial times (World Meteorological Organization [WMO] 2020).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	692	Anthropogenic emissions account for roughly 60 per cent of total methane fluxes to the atmosphere, amounting to around 365±30 megatons of methane (MtCH4)/year.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	693	Approximately 35 per cent come from fossil fuels (two thirds from oil and gas and one third from coal), 40 per cent from agriculture (three quarters from enteric fermentation and manure management and one quarter from rice) and 20 per cent from waste (mostly landfills and solid waste), with the remaining ~5 per cent emitted through biofuel and biomass burning (Saunois et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	694	The remaining roughly 40 per cent of total methane emissions are generated by several natural sources: inland freshwaters (including wetlands, lakes, reservoirs and rivers), geological releases, wild animals, termites and permafrost.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	695	Sectoral partitioning of methane emissions varies greatly among countries/regions and large uncertainties remain in both anthropogenic and natural emissions (figure 6.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	696	Over the last two decades, the main cause of increasing atmospheric methane is likely increasing anthropogenic emissions, with hotspot contributions from agriculture and waste in South and South-East Asia, South America and Africa, and from fossil fuels in China, the Russian Federation and the United States of America (Jackson et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	697	Emissions from natural sources may also be increasing, as wetlands warm, tropical rainfall increases and permafrost thaws.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	698	The size of methane sinks (mainly oxidation in the atmosphere), and how this varies over time, remain difficult to predict and study.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	699	Unlike CO2, little attention has been given to capturing methane from the air, and further assessment of the feasibility of methane removal is therefore required (Jackson et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	700	Although methane emission reductions are a necessary part of long-term mitigation strategies alongside CO2 reductions (Rogelj et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	701	As a result, there has been increased focus in recent years on the immediate need and opportunity to reduce methane emissions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	702	The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) released a Global Methane Assessment in May 2021, which analysed the benefits of reducing methane emissions, the  48 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On policies and costs of mitigation actions and the reductions needed to meet Paris Agreement goals (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] and Climate and Clean Air Coalition [CCAC] 2021).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	703	Several groups have recently analysed abatement potentials for methane, while others have both examined mitigation and described the impacts 1 The troposphere is the lowest level of the atmosphere, which includes surface air.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	704	The main findings of these studies are assessed below, with some elements highlighted and implications for nationally determined contributions (NDCs) explored.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	705	Coloured bars represent the minimum and maximum range of available estimates from top-down (TD) and bottom-up (BU) approaches.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	706	Methane stabilization at a level greater than the pre-industrial level will mean a longterm commitment to warming relative to the pre-industrial level, whereas changes in methane emissions will contribute further to future temperature changes.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	707	As a GHG that does not accumulate semi-permanently in the atmosphere, achieving net-zero methane emissions is not required for climate stabilization, nor is it expected, in marked contrast to the sum of CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O), for which net-zero emissions are required for stabilization (Rogelj et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	708	Methane abatement would affect warming rates in the near term, resulting in benefits for ecosystems and the ability of humans to adapt.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	709	As a precursor of tropospheric ozone,1 which can be toxic to both humans and plants, methane emissions affect public health and crop yields via air pollution.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	710	Defining the optimal path for methane emission reductions is therefore arguably more suited to a multiplebenefits analysis than other GHGs, rather than an analysis  49 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On only defined by a climate metric (though other GHGs may also have co-benefits that affect air pollution and health).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	711	As a result, many methane reduction measures have low or even negative costs, with many models examining least-cost pathways to meet low warming targets reducing methane sharply in the current decade (Harmsen et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	712	Depending on progress in mitigating emissions of long-lived GHGs, rapid reductions of methane are also likely to play a role in limiting peak warming (chapter 3).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	713	That role depends heavily on how quickly emissions of CO2 are reduced, how much CO2 removal is deployed, and on the emissions trajectories of other short-lived climate forcers.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	714	This assessment included sector-specific assumptions about technology turnover times, estimates for improvements in technology over time and the achievable pace of regulations.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	715	Costs include estimates for the future value of recovered gas as well as the discounting of future returns with rates of 4–10 per cent.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	716	Implementation of readily available methane-targeted abatement measures alongside broader structural and behavioural measures could reduce methane emissions by approximately 180 Mt/year by 2030, which is equal to nearly 50 per cent of current methane emissions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	717	Implementation of readily available methane-targeted measures alone (i.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	718	Methane emissions from this sector could be reduced by approximately 75 Mt/year (~2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	719	Within the sector, oil and gas has a substantially larger reduction potential than coal in two of the analyses and roughly equal potential in the third analysis.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	720	Based on the Global Methane Assessment, all-cost oil and gas emission mitigation potential is 25–58 Mt/year by 2030 and 35–95 Mt/year by 2050 (relative to projected BAU 2050 emissions of ~155 Mt/year).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	721	Averaged over all measures, abatement costs are quite similar for the coal subsector, but vary substantially for the oil and gas subsector.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	722	Restricting the analysis to low cost (< US$600/tCH4; < ~US$20/tCO2e using GWP100) measures only, ~17–32 Mt/year can be abated by 2030 in the oil and gas subsector, compared with ~8–24 Mt/year in the coal subsector.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	723	The largest and most cost-effective abatement potentials within the fossil fuel sector for 2030 are to prevent all venting of associated gas during oil and gas extraction (including from inefficient flaring), to install leak detection and repair programmes for natural gas infrastructure and to utilize ventilation air methane oxidation technology in coal mines (table 6.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	724	Reducing methane emissions from waste and agriculture will be more challenging but is crucial to achieving low warming targets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	725	For waste, the three analyses assessed in the Global Methane Assessment have very similar 2030 all-cost abatement potentials relative to projected 2030 BAU emissions (~28–32 Mt/year; ~30–35 per cent; ~0.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	726	The largest and most cost-effective abatement in the waste sector comes from municipal solid waste, typically either by diverting organic waste from the waste stream or capturing and utilizing landfill gas.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	727	More simply, covering landfills with soil is a very effective and low-cost measure, and reduces fires, odours and air pollution.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	728	This could be an attractive option for many tropical and subtropical megacities, which typically have extremely large and ill-managed landfills.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	729	Crop waste fires are widespread in the tropics, leading to significant air pollution and methane emissions from partial combustion.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	730	Such crop waste could instead be burned under controlled conditions to generate electricity or returned to the soil to provide nutrients.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	731	All-cost abatement estimates for rice cultivation have similar abatement potentials (~7–10 Mt/year) but vary markedly in costs (roughly US$3–100/tCO2e using GWP100), whereas low-cost abatement potentials and costs are quite similar across analyses.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	732	Abatement within rice cultivation is possible through changes in agricultural production techniques, such as alternate wetting and drying of paddy fields, though the benefits can be undermined by increased N2O emissions (table 6.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	733	In contrast, all-cost abatement potential estimates for the livestock sector have similar costs (~US$13–30/tCO2e using GWP100) but significantly varied abatement potentials (4 to > 40 Mt/year).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	734	These differences are largely attributable to assumptions about the feasibility of some countries being able to switch to higheryielding livestock breeds.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	735	The average abatement potential is therefore smallest in the agriculture sector at ~20–25 per cent.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	736	Several less well-established abatement options are also under study for the livestock sector, including feed substitutes and methane inhibitors (UNEP and CCAC 2020; Ocko et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	737	At the same time, substantial mitigation of livestock-related methane could be achieved through widespread changes in human dietary choices, possibly reaching 30 Mt/year (~0.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	738	The average abatement potential for waste across the three estimates roughly doubles between 2030 and 2050.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	739	Similarly, the average all-cost abatement potential in oil and gas increases to ~80 per cent of the 2050 value, with roughly half of these emission controls available at low net cost.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	740	Targeted abatement estimates (without behavioural changes) increase only modestly in agriculture, which is expected to become the main anthropogenic source of emissions in low warming scenarios (e.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	741	Abatement costs also change, with some of the most noticeable shifts being that oil and gas abatement will become more expensive on average.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	742	Changes in livestock abatement costs vary significantly among analyses.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	743	There are additional opportunities to reduce methane beyond methane-targeted abatement measures.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	744	These include fuel switching from natural gas to renewables in electricity generation and in buildings, and behavioural changes such as reduced consumption of cattle-based foods and reduced food waste and loss.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	745	Integrated assessment models show large ranges in potential methane mitigation due to these processes.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	746	On average, these models indicate that such actions could reduce methane emissions by another 15 per cent beyond the targeted measures, for a total 2030 reduction under 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	747	Global annual abatement potential in 2030 and 2050 (MtCH4 and MtCO2e) Sector Technical abatement measure 2030 MtCH4 2030 MtCO2e 2050 MtCH4 2050 MtCO2e Livestock Manure anaerobic digestion with biogas recovery on large farms >100 livestock units 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	748	Scenarios with strong climate change mitigation policies include decarbonizing the economy, which would reduce methane leakage from fossil fuel systems due to reduced demand.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	749	However, decarbonization will lead to more abandoned oil and gas wells and coal mines, which would need targeted actions to reduce methane emissions that are distinct from direct decarbonization policies (e.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	750	By 2050, methane abatement associated with decarbonization alone is only about 30 per cent of the methane abatement seen under a broad multi-pollutant, multi-policy 2°C scenario, emphasizing the large role played by methanespecific policies.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	751	On a more fundamental physical level, the less methane is reduced, the smaller the available carbon budget will be that is consistent with a given target (e.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	752	Quantitatively, every ~100 Mt of methane emissions reduced and kept reduced increases the cumulative twentyfirst century carbon budget by around 450 GtCO2.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	753	There are also many linkages between methane reduction actions and opportunities for decarbonization.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	754	For example, within land use, the abatement of livestock-related methane typically involves reduced demand for cattle, which then frees up pasture and feed lands for potential production of biofuels or afforestation.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	755	Methane-formed surface ozone is known to reduce the growth rate of many plants, affecting both crops (and therefore land use, as a greater area would be required to produce the same yield) and decreasing CO2 uptake by forests (e.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	756	Finally, using organic material from landfills as plastic substitutes could reduce the need for petroleum-based plastics, which could play a role in the transition away from fossil fuels (though likely a modest role), while reducing landfill-related methane emissions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	757	As shown, several methane mitigation pathways also have the potential to contribute to CO2 mitigation.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	758	The emissions implications of many major emitters’ first NDC commitments have been analysed as part of a large international research project.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	759	Using a suite of global and national models and 2 The assessment in this chapter only considers the first round of NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	760	The project also examined a least-cost 2°C scenario (accounting for mitigation costs only, and excluding environmental costs), with reductions starting in 2020 and a 66 per cent chance of staying below 2°C.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	761	According to those estimates, some countries have made pledges that would lead to substantial decreases in their methane emissions by 2030 (table 6.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	762	Extrapolating countries’ NDCs reveals that most are projected to achieve substantially greater reductions by 2050 than 2030.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	763	However, most of the world is not yet as close to 2°C pathways, so at the global scale, NDCs are expected to deliver only about a third of 2030 methane reductions expected under 2°C scenarios.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	764	Among the major emitting countries analysed, China, the Russian Federation, India and Australia show the greatest emission gaps for methane, with their NDC reductions relative to their 2°C reductions less than the global mean for both 2030 and 2050.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	765	The NDCs are therefore projected to deliver only about one quarter of 2030 reductions in 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	766	The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) has also carried out analyses of the impact of NDCs on methane for the European Union, which show decreases of 21 per cent by 2030 and 34 per cent by 2050 (relative to 2015), results that are very similar to those shown in table 6.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	767	Although ranges across the models were not specified for methane alone, the tenth to ninetieth percentile range of the emissions gap between the NDCs and 2°C scenario for all GHGs was ~36 per cent at the global level and 30–55 per cent at the national level, indicating that a similar uncertainty range is appropriate for methane estimates.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	768	Although there are signs that transformation is taking place in some parts of the world, more ambitious efforts are clearly needed if the world is to aim for 2°C or 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	769	In countries or regions with large projected decreases in methane emissions, specific policies have been put into place to achieve such reductions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	770	Examples include the 2016 North American Leaders’ Summit agreement to reduce oil and gas methane emissions by 40–45 per cent by 2025 (relative to 2012) in Canada, Mexico and the United States of America, the European Union’s 2020 strategy to reduce methane emissions (COM/2020/663 final) and the goals of Nigeria and Côte d'Ivoire to reduce oil and gas methane emissions by 60–75 per cent by 2030 as part of the UNEP and CCAC Global Methane Alliance.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	771	In September 2021, the United States of America and the European Union announced a Global Methane Pledge to reduce anthropogenic methane emissions by at least 30 per cent globally relative to 2020 levels by 2030.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	772	On 11 October 2021, they reported that more than 30 additional countries had committed to joining the Pledge, with coverage now including nine of the top 20 methane emitters globally, and urged others to sign on before the official launch at the twenty-sixth United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	773	There is a clear need for increased ambition almost everywhere, with possible actions that policymakers could consider including increased efforts to build on growing momentum to monitor and address environmental impacts within the private investment community.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	774	More transparent data on sector-specific ‘best practice’ methane emissions would help support a market for both monitoring and mitigation services by facilitating the identification of the bestperforming companies.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	775	Every country emits GHGs from municipal waste, which is largely generated by the human population (Eggelston et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	776	In NDCs representing 174 countries, 137 included general waste sector mitigation commitments, with 67 citing specific mitigation actions (Powell et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	777	The most common mitigation action was improved landfilling, followed by converting waste into energy (e.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	778	Improvements in waste management systems could provide public health co-benefits, such as reducing hazards associated with wastewater mismanagement, improving air quality and diminishing land and water contamination (Mittal et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	779	Agricultural methane emissions primarily derive from animal stocks and rice cultivation, as well as deliberate biomass burning, factors that vary widely from country to country (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] 2021).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	780	In their first NDCs, 32 countries referred to ‘climate-smart agriculture’, with aims to optimize agricultural systems to increase productivity and incomes, enhance resilience and reduce GHG emissions (Strohmaier et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	781	However, countries rarely included quantitative targets for reducing agricultural methane emissions (Hönle et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	782	In fact, of the top 46 countries that contribute to 90 per cent of global agricultural emissions, only a quarter included broadly-stated measures targeting emissions from ruminant livestock.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	783	This may be due to relatively high abatement costs and the impact such measures may have on economically important sectors such as beef and dairy.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	784	Mitigation measures such as sustainable intensification of rice cultivation were more likely to be included, in part because they present clear co-benefits for modernization or productivity (Hönle et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	785	The magnitude of agricultural methane emissions suggests that agriculture should receive more attention than it currently does in methane mitigation strategies, and that strategies that include changes in consumption through a food systems approach will need to be considered (Tubiello et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	786	Setting quantitative goals for cropland and livestock management, which could come in the form of targets for best practices, would help countries raise their ambition in this sector.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	787	Improved monitoring at the facility level could serve to motivate action to reduce emissions and to verify the effectiveness of such action.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	788	This would open up opportunities for regulators to use flexible policy instruments that directly target measurable emission reductions compared with more prescriptive best available technology standards.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	789	Effectively prioritizing methane sources, reducing methane emissions and tracking mitigation progress necessitates a broad suite of measurement-based technologies that draw on the unique advantages of each.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	790	Traditional bottom-up approaches, based on sourcespecific emission factors combined with statistical activity data (for example, livestock numbers, amount of oil and gas extracted), have inherent uncertainties that can be large at the national/sectoral scale (figure 6.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	791	Even in countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom, which have well-established emission reporting systems, methane inventories have been revised by up to 60 per cent between subsequent submissions (Bergamaschi et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	792	New top-down approaches have been developed that use atmospheric observations (at the surface, airborne or from satellites), which when combined with atmospheric transport models, can be applied to determine emissions for a specific facility, sector, region or other aggregation.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	793	These top-down approaches have proven effective in correcting emission factors and in revising sectoral methane emissions in multiple geographies (e.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	794	Top-down approaches can also support the transparency of reporting processes, with the updated IPCC reporting guidelines recommending the application of such approaches as additional quality control (Bartram et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	795	However, at present, only Switzerland and the United Kingdom include top-down methane estimates in an annex to their national inventory reports (Manning et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	796	New observational capabilities are revealing emission hotspots and facility- or city-scale emissions through measurements from cars, drones and aircraft, and satellite remote sensing, especially in remote world regions, which in at least a few cases has led to industry action to eliminate major emission point sources (Nisbet et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	797	However, at a larger scale, top-down methods depend highly on the density of observations and are challenged by the difficulty in disentangling different sources and separating natural emissions from anthropogenic emissions, which is crucial for many countries with large natural emissions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	798	Compared with high-frequency in situ surface measurements, satellite observations have a broader coverage but less sensitivity to methane sources, and are limited by cloud coverage.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	799	Further deployment of mobile measurements and fixed stations should therefore be supported to better monitor methane concentrations, especially over tropical and boreal regions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	800	The International Energy Agency (IEA) Methane Tracker (2020) already includes data on leaked methane of super emitters, which is detected by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), with a new generation of satellites, such as GHGSat (Varon et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	801	Market mechanisms are therefore seen as an important component in collective action to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	802	In principle, the role of markets within the context of the agreement is to enable all parties engaged in mitigation actions to implement these in a cost-effective manner, while simultaneously providing an opportunity to enhance their ambition.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	803	Under article 6, the Paris Agreement provides for an international framework for market mechanisms to enable greater ambition in both mitigation and adaptation actions (Bodansky et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	804	It also allows countries to voluntarily cooperate to achieve their NDCs, “promote sustainable development and ensure environmental integrity and transparency” (article 6.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	805	The fact that 87 per cent of new and updated NDCs specify countries’ intentions to possibly use voluntary cooperation under article 6 (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] 2021) confirms a significantly increased interest in this approach, compared with previous NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	806	Although article 6 established these principles, the rules that facilitate their implementation in practice are still the subject of negotiations, including guidance for cooperative approaches (article 6.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	807	These rules, modalities and procedures are an anticipated key outcome of the of twenty-sixth United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	808	There is already considerable experience in designing and implementing market mechanisms to control pollutants, including different forms of carbon markets (Schmalensee and Stavins 2017; Michaelowa et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	809	Such markets include both voluntary and compliancedriven programmes, which are used both domestically and internationally to reduce emissions, and involve different types of allowances and credits and both public and private sector entities as buyers and sellers (box 1, figure 7.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	810	Current state of carbon markets Compliance carbon markets are marketplaces in which participants act in response to an obligation established by a regulatory body.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	811	The most prominent examples of such markets are national or regional emissions trading systems.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	812	In national emissions trading systems, governments set a cap on the aggregate level of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that regulated entities can emit over a period of time.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	813	These entities are required to submit an emission permit (or allowance) for each ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) they emit.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	814	Emissions trading systems can be restricted to domestic borders or may have international elements through links with other emissions trading systems (e.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	815	In voluntary carbon markets, participants are under no formal obligation to achieve a specific target.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	816	Instead, companies, private entities and national governments seek to voluntarily offset their emissions, for example, as part of a social responsibility strategy.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	817	Voluntary buyers can procure domestic or international carbon credits from various different crediting programmes, as well as allowances from compliance markets (Doda et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	818	Compliance carbon markets have historically generated more mitigation action and stronger incentives for decarbonization than voluntary carbon markets, though they may face more political opposition and entail higher regulatory burdens.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	819	Voluntary carbon markets can be an important tool to mobilize the private sector and expand the reach of carbon markets beyond sectors and regions subject to explicit climate regulation.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	820	In terms of structure, domestic carbon markets have the advantage of normally allowing better oversight and control through full regulatory control by a relevant authority, with little risk of spillover effects from other systems or jurisdictions, and all mitigation benefits accrued domestically.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	821	Adding international elements to markets will increase their complexity, but also presents a significant advantage of potentially reducing compliance costs by making use of cheaper mitigation opportunities in other jurisdictions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	822	Market typology Domestic Compliance Voluntary International Domestic carbon markets Government compliance with international country targets (UNFCCC) Figure 7.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	823	This chapter initially provides an assessment of the potential role of market mechanisms under the Paris Agreement in both the near term and in achieving long-term climate goals (section 7.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	824	Countries have prepared their NDCs using different target types and metrics ranging from reductions in all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions relative to a fixed emissions level (e.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	825	The heterogenous nature of the current NDCs in this way creates challenges for both negotiating and establishing effective real-world markets, as well as the risks of double counting, emission leakages and unattainable targets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	826	There is growing interest from countries in using markets and voluntary cooperation to implement their NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	827	As of 30 July 2021, the share of parties that indicated an intention or possibility of using voluntary cooperation has nearly doubled, from 44 to 87 per cent in the new or updated NDCs, compared with previous NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	828	Moreover, the share of parties that have set qualitative limits on voluntary cooperation, such as using certain standards and guidelines to ensure additionality and avoid double counting, has increased from 19 to 39 per cent (UNFCCC 2021).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	829	The existing quantitative literature that estimates the maximum potential gains from cooperation generally assumes that the heterogeneous NDCs could be translated into a common comprehensive, transferable emissions mitigation metric.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	830	This is evidently not something that is going to happen quickly, if at all, and the results must therefore be interpreted as estimates of potential gains from cooperation compared with independent implementation of the same targets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	831	These studies do not include ancillary domestic benefits that may have motivated countries’ choice of NDC target methods.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	832	With the aim of achieving the current NDC ambition through global cooperation, most models estimate a global carbon price of US$9–38/tCO2 between 2025 and 2030.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	833	As a result, the estimated mitigation costs by 2030 in an ideal situation could be reduced by 40–60 per cent through the full use of market mechanisms (Aldy et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	834	Although there are uncertainties associated with economic modelling, results in all studies suggest significant potential cost reductions and economic gains from using market mechanisms.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	835	These results provide a strong incentive for countries to negotiate a credible agreement on article 6 and to move towards more compatible NDCs over time.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	836	The modelling studies estimate that around 4–5 GtCO2e could be traded per year by 2030 with a market volume of US$60–100 billion per year if NDCs are transformed into tradable emission mitigation actions (Fujimori et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	837	Net market transactions constitute balance-of-trade changes and therefore changes to participants’ gross domestic product (GDP) and/or exchange rate position.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	838	For selling regions, this would represent a potentially significant new net export (Piris-Cabezas et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	839	The extent to which this will actually occur is very uncertain, with many parties emphasizing domestic implementation and mentioning flexible mechanisms as an additionality in their NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	840	Carbon markets shift both emission mitigation actions and emission mitigation investments from buyers to sellers.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	841	Provided that sellers are primarily developing countries, carbon markets have the potential to transfer emission mitigation-related capital towards developing economies, help prevent lock-ins to carbon-intensive infrastructure and contribute to capacity-building to further reduce emissions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	842	Redistributing capital investments potentially carries implications for other sustainability metrics, such as local air quality, forest conservation, rural livelihoods, food prices, water quality and energy access, as well as for the regional distribution of incentives for technology development and innovation.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	843	While increasing emission mitigation innovations in selling regions, carbon markets could reduce incentives in buying regions.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	845	However, under different policy designs, near-term flexibility facilitated by low-cost mitigation options, such as reducing tropical devastation, can free resources to boost investments into research and development and yield improved technologies in the longer term (Szolgayová, Golub and Fuss 2014; Koch et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	846	Studies of potential emissions mitigation with international markets indicate that land-use emission mitigation opportunities are undertaken earlier than under independent NDC implementation (Edmonds et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	847	By valuing land-use change emissions, international carbon markets can also provide incentives to prevent deforestation and increase afforestation and reforestation (Lubowski and Rose 2013; Fujimori et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	848	The need for an interlinked implementation of climate goals and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is being increasingly recognized at the political level to enhance synergies and maximize co-benefits.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	849	However, tools and approaches to assess and report on sustainable development impacts of article 6 cooperative approaches are lacking and remain an unresolved topic in negotiations (Olsen, Arens and Mersmann 2018; Kachi and Mooldijk 2020).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	850	Similarly, there are unresolved issues about how the use of cooperative approaches can be designed to contribute to financing adaptation in vulnerable countries with limited potential for direct participation.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	851	As of 13 September 2021, 50 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have announced net-zero targets, of which five parties have explicitly indicated their intent to use international trading to achieve their net-zero pledges.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	852	In addition, a growing number of non-State and subnational actors have made net-zero pledges with trading considered.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	853	When global net carbon emissions start to approach zero, carbon market conditions will be very different to how they are currently.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	854	Reducing global carbon emissions to net zero involves reducing carbon emissions to near zero in all sectors in all regions, with emissions that remain positive being offset by so-called negative emissions or carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (see chapter 3).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	855	As discussed in chapter 3, net-zero pledges across countries and organizations have different timings, sectoral coverage, gas coverage and legal statuses.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	856	Further complexity arises from uncertainty in how to treat the various forms of CO2 removal (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2019) in carbon markets.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	857	Some carbon markets (Australia, Colombia, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea, and California, Alberta and China’s regional systems) already recognize the role of nature-based removal credits and the long-term importance of bringing emission sources and sinks into a common market framework aimed at achieving net-zero emissions (La Hoz Theuer et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	858	To reach global net-zero emissions, countries with emissions greater than zero may need to be balanced by countries with negative emissions.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	859	Almost all global net-zero scenarios assessed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on global warming of 1.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	860	Their findings revealed significant variations in the timing in which countries reached net-zero emissions, which indicates that there is potential for using market mechanisms to achieve a global net-zero goal.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	861	The magnitude, value and patterns of emissions trading to reach a global net-zero target are dynamic and depend on several factors, such as the use of CO2 removal technologies and the timing of reaching net zero in each region (Yu et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	862	Market size, for example, reaches US$300–400 billion in 2030 and around US$1 trillion in 2050 in scenarios with different net-zero timings.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	863	Studies have found that land resources also play an important role (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] 2018; Yu et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	864	Removal credits by technology-based CO2 removal approaches could play an increasingly important role to achieve net-zero emissions but will be limited by the global removal capacity of these technologies (Allen et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	865	Enhancing ambition through carbon markets The main goal of article 6 of the Paris Agreement is to enable parties to increase their ambition towards achieving the agreement’s long-term goals.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	866	Many researchers have documented that the initial nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are insufficient to be aligned with trajectories to reach the long-term Paris Agreement goals (Fawcett et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	867	Although these calculations are evidently speculative, they highlight both the potential power of carbon markets and how far NDCs need to be enhanced to capture that potential.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	868	Rather, they create conditions that make enhanced ambitions more attractive through the implicit incentive that emissions mitigation is cost-effective, thereby lowering political and stakeholder resistance to tightening targets and facilitating emission reductions and strengthened targets over time.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	869	Experience from the world’s current major emissions trading systems supports this approach (Parker 2019).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	870	Emissions within trading systems have always fallen faster and at a lower cost than initially expected (Haites 2018).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	871	Periods of low prices have been followed by a period of policy reassessment and more ambitious targets, as seen under the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and California’s cap-and-trade programme.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	872	These include, for example, taxing or ‘cancelling’ a portion of emission mitigation trades.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	873	Under a fixed emissions budget, such schemes could increase overall emissions abatement in the near term.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	874	In the long term, this prevents markets from lowering costs and thereby from facilitating increases in ambition.

https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	876	These include establishing robust rules to ensure environmental integrity, including the avoidance of double counting, capacity-building and the management of potential carbon leakages.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	877	Parties have different views on how to define the scope of NDCs, for example, whether to define them in terms of sectors, gases and/or policies and measures.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	878	There is also disagreement over whether corresponding adjustments should be required for internationally transferred mitigation outcomes generated outside the scope of selling countries’ NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	879	Many NDCs only include single-year targets, such as 2025 or 2030, which raises the question of how to treat noncompliance years when accounting for internationally transferred mitigation outcomes.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	880	Several accounting methods have been put forward to address this challenge (Greiner et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	881	Some NDC emission mitigation targets (Graichen, Cames and Schneider 2016; Vaidyula and Hood 2018; Schneider et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	882	Uncertainties in BAU emission projections may weaken the actual ambition of mitigation targets (Hood, Briner and Rocha 2014; Graichen, Cames and Schneider 2016; Hood and Soo 2017; Vaidyula and Hood 2018; and Rocha and Ellis 2020).
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	883	The scope of NDCs also differ in terms of sectors and GHGs: some cover all sectors and all GHGs, some have more limited coverage and others are unclear and only include indicators, such as policies and measures.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	884	The lack of a fixed emissions limit in many NDCs makes accounting complex.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	885	Some researchers have recommended the use of economy-wide absolute emission targets for all NDCs to facilitate robust accounting and reduce complexity  62 Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On (Graichen, Cames and Schneider 2016; Schneider et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	886	Although this is not likely to happen anytime soon, parties could be requested to provide clearer and more transparent NDC targets as a potential short-term step.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	887	For this purpose, the Katowice Climate Package includes detailed provisions on how countries should describe or clarify the scope of their NCDs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	888	However, some provisions of this package are only mandatory for second and subsequent NDCs or require countries to provide relevant information by 2024 (Schneider et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	889	The treatment of mitigation outcomes generated outside the scope of NDCs is an important issue in negotiations.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	890	The main advantages of allowing emission reductions outside the scope of NDCs include the full utilization of mitigation potential, reduced mitigation costs, improved data quality of uncovered sectors and the facilitation of their inclusion into future NDCs (Spalding-Fecher 2017; Schneider et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	891	Disadvantages include disincentives to enhancing the scope of NDCs, a lack of fairness, scrutiny and quality assurance, and double-counting risks (Spalding-Fecher 2017; Howard 2018; Warnecke et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	892	Many options have been raised to address the above cited concerns, such as applying corresponding adjustments regardless of NDC scope, bringing relevant sectors and GHGs into the scope of next NDCs, imposing international oversight on the quality of NDCs and restrictions on the number of and deadline for achieving internationally transferred mitigation outcomes, quantifying NDC targets in terms of GHG emissions and specifying the scope of NDCs (Marcu et al.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	893	Care needs to be taken in framing such offset programmes so that macroscale outcomes deliver the intended aggregate emissions mitigation.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	894	Although some of the proposed options are ideal in theory, they may lack political feasibility.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	895	Many parties have been concerned by potential limitations on article 6 participation and threats to the bottom-up nature of NDCs.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	896	The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) could be a useful reference in this regard, as despite receiving many criticisms, it has played a crucial role in facilitating or enhancing many countries’ mitigation efforts.
https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021	897	In many developing countries, the capacities developed through participation in the CDM (e.
